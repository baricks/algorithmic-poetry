A PATTERN LANGUAGE
TOWNS · BUILDINGS · CONSTRUCTION

A PATTERN LANGUAGE is the second in a series of books which
describe an entirely new attitude to architecture and planning.

The books are intended to provide a complete working
alternative to our present ideas about architecture, building,
and planning-an alternative which will, we hope, gradually
replace current ideas and practices.

volume I THE TIMELESS WAY OF BUILDING
volume  A PATTERN LANGUAGE
volume  THE OREGON EXPERIMENT


Volume , The Timeless Way of Building, and Volume
2,  A Pattern Language, are two halves of a single work.

This book provides a language, for building and planning;
the other book provides the theory and instructions
for the use of the language. This book describes the
detailed patterns for towns and neighborhoods, houses,
gardens, and rooms. The other book explains the discipline
which makes it possible to use these patterns to
create a building or a town. This book is the sourcebook of
the timeless way; the other is its practice and its origin.
The two books have evolved very much in parallel.
They have been growing over the last eight years, as
we have worked on the one hand to understand the
nature of the building process, and on the other hand to
construct an actual, possible pattern language. We have
been forced by practical considerations, to publish these
two books under separate covers; but in fact, they form
an indivisible whole. It is possible to read them separately.
But to gain the insight which we have tried to
communicate in them, it is essential that you read them
both.

The Timeless Way of Building describes the fundamental
nature of the task of making towns and buildings.
lX

It is shown there, that towns and buildings will not be
able to become alive, unless they are made by all the
people in society, and unless these people share a common
pattern language, within which to make these
buildings, and unless this common pattern language is
alive itself.

In this book, we present one possible pattern language,
of the kind called for in The Timeless Way. This language
is extremely practical. It is a language that we
have distilled from our own building and planning efforts
over the last eight years. You can use it to work
with your neighbors, to improve your town and neighborhood.
You can use it to design a house for yourself,
with your family; or to work with other people to design
an office or a workshop or a public building like a
school. And you can use it to guide you in the actual
process of construction.

The elements of this language are entities called patterns.
Each pattern describes a problem which occurs
over and over again in our environment, and then
describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such
a way that you can use this solution a million times over,
without ever doing it the same way twice.

For convenience and clarity, each pattern has the same
format. First, there is a picture, which shows an archetypal
example of that pattern. Second, after the picture,
each pattern has an introductory paragraph, which sets
the context for the pattern, by explaining how it helps
to complete certain larger patterns. Then there are three
diamonds to mark the beginning of the problem. After
the diamonds there is a headline, in bold type. This
headline gives the essence of the problem in one or two
sentences. After the headline comes the body of the
problem. This is the longest section. It describes the
empirical background of the pattern, the evidence for its
validity, the range of different ways the pattern can be
manifested in a building, and so on. Then, again in
bold type, like the headline, is the solution-the heart
of the pattern-which describes the field of physical and
social relationships which are required to solve the stated
problem, in the stated context. This solution is always
stated in the form of an instruction-so that you know
exactly what you need to do, to build the pattern. Then,
after the solution, there is a diagram, which shows the
solution in the form of a diagram, with labels to indicate
its main components.

After the diagram, another three diamonds, to show
that the main body of the pattern is finished. And finally,
after the diamonds there is a paragraph which ties the
pattern to all those smaller patterns in the language,
which are needed to complete this pattern, to embellish
it, to fill it out.
There are two essential purposes behind this format.
First, to present each pattern connected to other patterns,
so that you grasp the collection of all  patterns as a
whole, as a language, within which you can create an infinite
variety of combinations. Second, to present the
problem and solution of each pattern in such a way that
you can judge it for yourself, and modify it, without
losing the essence that is central to it.
Let us next understand the nature of the connection
between patterns.

The patterns are ordered, beginning with the very
largest, for regions and towns, then working down
through neighborhoods, clusters of buildings, buildings,
rooms and alcoves, ending finally with details of construction.
This order, which is presented as a straight linear
sequence, is essential to the way the language works. It is
presented, and explained more fully, in the next section.
What is most important about this sequence, is that it is
based on the connections between the patterns. Each
pattern is connected to certain "larger" patterns which
come above it in the language; and to certain "smaller"
patterns which come below it in the language. The pattern
helps to complete those larger patterns which are
"above" it, and is itself completed by those smaller patterns
which are "below" it.
Thus, for example, you will find that the pattern ACCESSIBLE
GREEN  0), is connected first to certain larger
patterns: SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY  ), IDENTIFIABLE
NEIGHBORHOOD  ), WORK COMMUNITY  ), and
QUIET BACKS  ). These appear on its first page. And it
is also connected to certain smaller patterns: POSITIVE
OUTDOOR SPACE 07), TREE PLACES 1), and GARDEN
w ALL   3). These appear on its last page.
What this means, is that IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD,
SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY, WORK COMMUNITY, and
QUIET BACKS are incomplete, unless they contain an ACCESSIBLE
GREEN; and that an ACCESSIBLE GREEN is itself
incomplete, unless it contains POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,
TREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.
And what it means in practical terms is that, if you
want to lay out a green according to this pattern, you
must not only follow the instructions which describe the
pattern itself, but must also try to embed the green
within an IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD or in some SUBCULTURE
BOUNDARY, and in a way that helps to form
QUIET BACKS; and then you must work to complete the
green by building in some POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,
TREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.
In short, no pattern is an isolated entity. Each pattern
can exist in the world, only to the extent that is supported
by other patterns: the larger patterns in which it
is embedded, the patterns of the same size that surround
it, and the smaller patterns which are embedded in it.
This is a fundamental view of the world. It says that
when you build a thing you cannot merely build that
thing in isolation, but must also repair the world around
it, and within it, so that the larger world at that one
place becomes more coherent, and more whole; and the
thing which you make takes its place in the web of nature,
as you make it.

Now we explain the nature of the relation between
problems and solutions, within the individual patterns.
Each solution is stated in such a way that it gives the
essential field of relationships needed to solve the problem,
but in a very general and abstract way-so that you
can solve the problem for yourself, in your own way, by
adapting it to your preferences, and the local conditions
at the place where you are making it.

For this reason, we have tried to write each solution
in a way which imposes nothing on you. It contains only
those essentials which cannot be avoided if you really
want to solve the problem. In this sense, we have tried,
in each solution, to capture the invariant property common
to all places which succeed in solving the problem.
But of course, we have not always succeeded. The
solutions we have given to these problems vary in significance.
Some are more true, more profound, more certain,
than others. To show this clearly we have marked
every pattern, in the text itself, with two asterisks, or one
asterisk, or no asterisks.

In the patterns marked with two asterisks, we believe
that we have succeeded in stating a true invariant: in
short, that the solution we have stated summarizes a
property common to all possible ways of solving the
stated problem. In these two-asterisk cases we believe,
in short, that it is not possible to solve the stated problem
properly, without shaping the environment in one
way or another according to the pattern that we have
given-and that, in these cases, the pattern describes
a deep and inescapable property of a well-formed environment.
In the patterns marked with one asterisk, we believe
that we have made some progress towards identifying
such an invariant: but that with careful work it will
certainly be possible to improve on the solution. In
these cases, we believe it would be wise for you to treat
the pattern with a certain amount of disrespect-and
that you seek out variants of the solution which we have
given, since there are almost certainly possible ranges of
solutions which are not covered by what we have written.
Finally, in the patterns without an asterisk, we are
certain that we have not succeeded in defining a true
invariant-that, on the contrary, there are certainly ways
of solving the problem different from the one which we
have given. In these cases we have still stated a solution,
in order to be concrete-to provide the reader with at
least one way of solving the problem-but the task of
finding the true invariant, the true property which lies
at the heart of all possible solutions to this problem, remains
undone.

We hope, of course, that many of the people who
read, and use this language, will try to improve these
patterns-will put their energy to work, in this task of
finding more true, more profound invariants-and we
hope that gradually these more true patterns, which are
slowly discovered, as time goes on, will enter a common
language, which all of us can share.

You see then that the patterns are very much alive
and evolving. In fact, if you like, each pattern may be
looked upon as a hypothesis like one of the hypotheses of
science. In this sense, each pattern represents our current
best guess as to what arrangement of the physical environment
will work to solve the problem presented. The
empirical questions center on the problem-does it occur
and is it felt in the way we have described it?-and the
solution-does the arrangement we propose in fact resolve
the problem? And the asterisks represent our
degree of faith in these hypotheses. But of course, no
matter what the asterisks say, the patterns are still
hypotheses, all  of them-and are therefore all
tentative, all free to evolve under the impact of new
experience and observation.

Let us finally explain the status of this language, why
we have called it " " with the emphasis
on the word "A," and how we imagine this pattern
language might be related to the countless thousands
of other languages we hope that people will make
for themselves, in the future.

The Timeless Way of Building says that every society
which is alive and whole, will have its own unique and
distinct pattern language; and further, that every individual
in such a society will have a unique language,
shared in part, but which as a totality is unique to the
mind of the person who has it. In this sense, in a healthy
society there will be as many pattern languages as there
are people-even though these languages are shared and
similar.

The question then arises: What exactly is the status
of this published language? In what frame of mind, and
with what intention, are we publishing this language
here? The fact that it is published as a book means that
many thousands of people can use it. Is it not true that
there is a danger that people might come to rely on this
one printed language, instead of developing their own
languages, in their own minds/
The fact is, that we have written this book as a first
step in the society-wide process by which people will
gradually become conscious of their own pattern languages,
and work to improve them. We believe, and
have explained in The Timeless Way of Building, that
the languages which people have today are so brutal, and
so fragmented, that most people no longer have any
language to speak of at all-and what they do have is
not based on human, or natural considerations.
XVI

We have spent years trying to formulate this language,
in the hope that when a person uses it, he will
be so impressed by its power, and so joyful in its use,
that he will understand again, what it means to have a
living language of this kind. If we only succeed in that,
it is possible that each person may once again embark on
the construction and development of his own language perhaps
taking the language printed in this book, as a
point of departure.

And yet, we do believe, of course, that this language
which is printed here is something more than a manual,
or a teacher, or a version of a possible pattern language.
Many of the patterns here are archetypal-so deep, so
deeply rooted in the nature of things, that it seems likely
that they will be a part of human nature, and human action,
as much in five hundred years, as they are today.
We doubt very much whether anyone could construct
a valid pattern language, in his own mind, which did
not include the pattern ARCADES  I  for example, or
the pattern ALCOVES   ).

In this sense, we have also tried to penetrate, as deep
as we are able, into the nature of things in the environment:
and hope that a great part of this language, which
we print here, will be a core of any sensible human pattern
language, which any person constructs for himself,
in his own mind. In this sense, at least a part of the
language we have presented here, is the archetypal core
of all possible pattern languages, which can make people
feel alive and human.

A pattern language has the structure of a network. This
is explained fully in The Timeless Way of Building.
However, when we use the network of a language, we
always use it as a sequence, going through the patterns,
moving always from the larger patterns to the smaller,
always from the ones which create structures, to the ones
which then embellish those structures, and then to those
which embellish the embellishments ....

Since the language is in truth a network, there is no
one sequence which perfectly captures it. But the sequence
which follows, captures the broad sweep of the
full network; in doing so, it follows a line, dips down,
dips up again, and follows an irregular course, a little
like a needle following a tapestry.

The sequence of patterns is both a summary of the
language, and at the same time, an index to the patterns.
If you read through the sentences which connect the
groups of patterns to one another, you will get an overview
of the whole language. And once you get this overview,
you will then be able to find the patterns which
are relevant to your own project.

And finally, as we shall explain in the next section,
this sequence of patterns is also the "base map," from
which you can make a language for your own project,
by choosing the patterns which are most useful to you,
and leaving them more or less in the order that you
find them printed here.

We begin with that part of the language which defines
a town or community. These patterns can never be "designed"
or "built" in one fell swoop-but patient piecemeal
growth, designed in such a way that every individual
act is always helping to create or generate these
larger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the
years, make a community that has these global patterns
in it.

This completes the global patterns which define a
town or a community. We now start that part of the
language which gives shape to groups of buildings, and
individual buildings, on the land, in three dimensions.
These are the patterns which can be "designed" or
"built"-the patterns which define the individual buildings
and the space between buildings; where we are dealing
for the first time with patterns that are under the
control of individuals or small groups of individuals,
who are able to build the patterns all at once.
The first group of patterns helps to lay out the overall
arrangement of a group of buildings: the height and
number of these buildings, the entrances to the site, main
parking areas, and lines of movement through the complex;

fix the position of individual buildings on the site, within
the complex, one by one, according to the nature of the
site, the trees, the sun: this is one of the most important
moments in the language;

within the buildings' wings, lay out the entrances, the
gardens, courtyards, roofs, and terraces: shape both the
volume of the buildings and the volume of the space between
the buildings at the same time-remembering
that indoor space and outdoor space, yin and yang, must
always get their shape together;

At this stage, you have a complete design for an individual
building. If you have followed the patterns
given, you have a scheme of spaces, either marked on
the ground, with stakes, or on a piece of paper, accurate
to the nearest foot or so. You know the height of rooms,
the rough size and position of windows and doors, and
you know roughly how the roofs of the building, and
the gardens are laid out.
The next, and last part of the language, tells how to
XXXI

make a buildable building directly from this rough
scheme of spaces, and tells you how to build it, in detail.
Before you lay out structural details, establish a
philosophy of structure which will let the structure grow

CHOOSING A LANGUAGE
FOR YOUR PROJECT
All    patterns together form a language. They create
a coherent picture of an entire region, with the power
to generate such regions in a million forms, with infinite
variety in all the details.
It is also true that any small sequence of patterns from
this language is itself a language for a smaller part of
the environment; and this small list of patterns is then
capable of generating a million parks, paths, houses,
workshops, or gardens.
For example, consider the following ten patterns:
PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET 0)
SUNNY PLACE 1)
OUTDOOR ROOM  3)
SIX-FOOT BALCONY  I )
PATHS AND GOALS 0)
CEILING HEIGHT VARIETY 0)
COLUMNS AT THE CORNERS 12)
FRONT DOOR BENCH 2)
RAISED FLOWERS  )
DIFFERENT CHAIRS    l)
This short list of patterns is itself a language: it is one
of a thousand possible languages for a porch, at the front
of a house. One of us chose this small language, to build
XXXV

a porch onto the front of his house. This is the way the
language, and its patterns, helped to generate this porch.
I started with PR TV ATE TERRACE ON THE STREET  I 0). That
pattern calls for a terrace, slightly raised, connected to the house,
and on the street side. SUNNY PLACE   I suggests that a special
place on the sunny side of the yard should be intensified and
made into a place by the use of a patio, balcony, outdoor room,
etc. I used these two patterns to locate a raised platform on the
south side of the house.
To make this platform into an OUTDOOR ROOM 3), I put
it half under the existing roof overhang, and kept a mature
pyracanthus tree right smack in the middle of the platform. The
overhead foliage of the tree added to the roof-like enclosure of
the space. I put a wind screen of fixed glass on the west side of
the platform too, to give it even more enclosure.
I used SIX-FOOT BALCONY  I  to determine the size of the
platform. But this pattern had to be used judiciously and not
blindly-the reasoning for the pattern has to do with the minimum
space required for people to sit comfortably and carry on a
discussion around a small side-table. Since I wanted space for at
least two of these conversation areas-one under the roof for very
hot or rainy days, and one out under the sky for days when you
wanted to be full in the sun, the balcony had to be made I  x I
feet square.
Now PATHS AND GOALS  0): Usually, this pattern deals with
large paths in a neighborhood, and comes much earlier in a language.
But I used it in a special way. It says that the paths which
naturally get formed by people's walking, on the land, should be
preserved and intensified. Since the path to our front door cut
right across the corner of the place where I had planned to put
the platform, I cut the corner of the platform off.
The height of the platform above the ground was determined
by CEILING HEIGHT VARIETY  0). By building the platform
approximately one foot above the ground line, the ceiling height
of the covered portion came out at between  and  feet-just
right for a space as small as this. Since this height above the
ground level is just about right for sitting, the pattern FRONT
DOOR BENCH  2 was automatically satisfied.
There were three columns standing, supporting the roof over
XXXVl

the old porch. They had to stay where they are, because they hold
the roof up. But, following COLUMNS AT THE CORNERS 12),
the platform was very carefully tailored to their positions-so that
the columns help define the social spaces on either side of them.
Finally, we put a couple of flower boxes next to the "front door
bench"-it's nice to smell them when you sit there-according to
RAISED FLOWERS ). And the old chairs you can see in the
porch are DIFFERENT CHAIRS 1).
You can see, from this short example, how powerful
and simple   is. And you are now,
perhaps ready to appreciate how careful you must be,
when you construct a language for yourself and your
own project.
The finished porch
The character of the porch is given by the ten patterns
in this short language. In just this way, each part of the
environment is given its character by the collection of
patterns which we choose to build into it. The character
of what you build, will be given to it by the language of
patterns you use, to generate it.
XXXVII

For this reason, of course, the task of choosing a language
for your project is fundamental. The pattern language
we have given here contains  patterns. You
can therefore use it to generate an almost unimaginably
large number of possible different smaller languages,
for all the different projects you may choose to do,
simply by picking patterns from it.
We shall now describe a rough procedure by which
you can choose a language for your own project, first by
taking patterns from this language we have printed here,
and then by adding patterns of your own.
r. First of all, make a copy of the master sequence
(pages xix-xxxiv on which you can tick off the patterns
which will form the language for your project. If you
don't have access to a copying machine, you can tick off
patterns in the list printed in the book, use paper clips
to mark pages, write your own list, use paper markerswhatever
you like. But just for now, to explain it clearly,
we shall assume that you have a copy of the list in front
of you.
 Scan down the list, and find the pattern which
best describes the overall scope of the project you have
in mind. This is the starting pattern for your project.
Tick it.  If there are two or three possible candidates,
don't worry: just pick the one which seems best: the
others will fall in place as you move forward.)
 Turn to the starting pattern itself, in the book, and
read it through. Notice that the other patterns mentioned
by name at the beginning and at the end, of the
pattern you are reading, are also possible candidates for
your language. The ones at the beginning will tend to be
"larger" than your project. Don't include them, unless
xxxviii

you have the power to help create these patterns, at least
in a small way, in the world around your project. The
ones at the end are "smaller." Almost all of them will
be important. Tick all of them, on your list, unless you
have some special reason for not wanting to include
them.
 Now your list has some more ticks on it. Turn to
the next highest pattern on the list which is ticked, and
open the book to that pattern. Once again, it will lead
you to other patterns. Once again, tick those which are
relevant-especially the ones which are "smaller" that
come at the end. As a general rule, do not tick the ones
which are "larger" unless you can do something about
them, concretely, in your own project.

 When in doubt about a pattern, don't include it.
Your list can easily get too long: and if it does, it will
become confusing. The list will be quite long enough,
even if you only include the patterns you especially like.
 Keep going like this, until you have ticked all the
patterns you want for your project.

 Now, adjust the sequence by adding your own material.
If there are things you want to include in your
project, but you have not been able to find patterns which
correspond to them, then write them in, at an appropriate
point in the sequence, near other patterns which are
of about the same size and importance. For example,
there is no pattern for a sauna. If you want to include
one, write it in somewhere near BATHING ROOM  4)
m your sequence.
 And of course, if you want to change any patterns,
change them. There are often cases where you may have
a personal version of a pattern, which is more true, or
xxxix

more relevant for you. In this case, you will get the most
"power" over the language, and make it your own most
effectively, if you write the changes in, at the appropriate
places in the book. And, it will be most concrete of
all, if you change the name of the pattern too-so that
it captures your own changes clearly.

Suppose now that you have a language for your project.
The way to use the language depends very much
on its scale. Patterns dealing with towns can only be
implemented gradually, by grass roots action; patterns
for a building can be built up in your mind, and marked
out on the ground; patterns for construction must be
built physically, on the site. For this reason we have
given three separate instructions, for these three different
scales. For towns, see page ; for buildings, see page
 ; for construction, see page  .
The procedures for each of these three scales are described
in much more detail with extensive examples,
in the appropriate chapters of The Timeless Way of
Building. For the town-see chapters  and ; for an
individual building-see chapters 0,  I, and 2; and for
the process of construction which describes the way a
building is actually built see chapter .

THE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE
Finally, a note of caution. This language, like English,
can be a medium for prose, or a medium for poetry. The
difference between prose and poetry is not that different
languages are used, but that the same language is used,
differently. In an ordinary English sentence, each word
has one meaning, and the sentence too, has one simple
meaning. In a poem, the meaning is far more dense.
Each word carries several meanings; and the sentence
as a whole carries an enormous density of interlocking
meanings, which together illuminate the whole.
The same is true for pattern languages. It is possible
to make buildings by stringing together patterns, in a
rather loose way. A building made like this, is an assembly
of patterns. It is not dense. It is not profound.
But it is also possible to put patterns together in such a
way that many many patterns overlap in the same
physical space: the building is very dense; it has many
meanings captured in a small space; and through this
density, it becomes profound.
In a poem, this kind of density, creates illumination,
by making identities between words, and meanings,
whose identity we have not understood before. In "O
Rose thou art sick," the rose is identified with many

greater, and more personal things than any rose-and
the poem illuminates the person, and the rose, because of
this connection. The connection not only illuminates the
words, but also illuminates our actual lives.
 Rose thou art sick.
The invisible worm,
That flies in the night
In the howling storm:
Has found out thy bed
Of crimson joy:
And his dark secret love
Does thy life destroy.
WILLIAM BLAKE
The same exactly, happens in a building. Consider, for
example, the two patterns BATHING ROOM  4 and
STILL WATER   I). One defines a part of a house where
you can bathe yourself slowly, with pleasure, perhaps
in company; a place to rest your limbs, and to relax. The
other is a place in a neighborhood, where this is water
to gaze into, perhaps to swim in, where children can sail
boats, and splash about, which nourishes those parts of
ourselves which rely on water as one of the great
elements of the unconscious.
Suppose now, that we make a complex of buildings
where individual bathing rooms are somehow connected
to a common pond, or lake, or pool-where the bathing
room merges with this common place; where there is no
sharp distinction between the individual and family processes
of the bathing room, and the common pleasure
of the common pool. In this place, these two patterns
xlii
THE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE
exist in the same space; they are identified; there is a
compression of the two, which requires less space, and
which is more profound than in a place where they are
merely side by side. The compression illuminates each
of the patterns, sheds light on its meaning; and also illuminates
our lives, as we understand a little more about
the connections of our inner needs.
But this kind of compression is not only poetic and
profound. It is not only the stuff of poems and exotic
statements, but to some degree, the stuff of every English
sentence. To some degree, there is compression in every
single word we utter, just because each word carries the
whisper of the meanings of the words it is connected to.
Even "Please pass the butter, Fred" has some compression
in it, because it carries overtones that lie in the connections
of these words to all the words which came before
it.
Each of us, talking to our friends, or to our families,
makes use of these compressions, which are drawn out
from the connections between words which are given by
the language. The more we can feel all the connections
in the language, the more rich and subtle are the things
we say at the most ordinary times.
And once again, the same is true in building. The compression
of patterns into a single space, is not a poetic
and exotic thing, kept for special buildings which are
works of art. It is the most ordinary economy of space. It
is quite possible that all the patterns for a house might,
in some form be present, and overlapping, in a simple
one-room cabin. The patterns do not need to be strung
out, and kept separate. Every building, every room,
xii ii
THE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE
every garden is better, when all the patterns which it
needs are compressed as far as it is possible for them to
be. The building will be cheaper; and the meanings in it
will be denser.
It is essential then, once you have learned to use the
language, that you pay attention to the possibility of
compressing the many patterns which you put together,
in the smallest possible space. You may think of this
process of compressing patterns, as a way to make the
cheapest possible building which has the necessary patterns
in it. It is, also, the only way of using a pattern
language to make buildings which are poems.
xliv
TOWNS

We begin with that part of the language which defines a
town or a community. These patterns can never be "designed"
or "built" in one fell swoop-but patient piecemeal
growth, designed in such a way that every individual
act is always helping to create or generate these
larger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the
years, make a community that has these global patterns
in it.

The first  patterns deal with the large-scale structure
of the environment: the growth of town and country,
the layout of roads and paths, the relationship between
work and family, the formation of suitable public
institutions for a neighborhood, the kinds of public space
required to support these institutions.
We believe that the patterns presented in this section
can be implemented best by piecemeal processes, where
each project built or each planning decision made is sanctioned
by the community according as it does or does not
help to form certain large-scale patterns. We do not believe
that these large patterns, which give so much structure
to a town or of a neighborhood, can be created by
centralized authority, or by laws, or by master plans. We
believe instead that they can emerge gradually and organically,
almost of their own accord, if every act of
building, large or small, takes on the responsibility for
gradually shaping its small corner of the world to make
, these larger patterns appear there.
In the next few pages we shall describe a planning

TOWNS
process which we believe is compatible with this piecemeal
approach.
 The core of the planning process we propose is
this: The region is made up of a hierarchy of social and
political groups, from the smallest and most local groups
-families, neighborhoods, and work groups-to the
largest groups-city councils, regional assemblies.
Imagine for example a metropolitan region composed
very roughly of the following groups, each group a coherent
political entity:
A. The region: ,000, people.
B. The major city: 00, people.
C. Communities and small towns: -10, people
each.
D. Neighborhoods: 00- people each.
E. House clusters and work communities: 0- people
each.
F. Families and work groups: - people each.
 Each group makes its own decisions about the environment
it uses in common. Ideally, each group actually
owns the common land at its "level." And higher
groups do not own or control the land belonging to
lower groups-they only own and control the common
land that lies between them, and which serves the higher
group. For instance, a community of  might own
the public land lying between its component neighborhoods,
but not the neighborhoods themselves. A cooperative
house cluster would own the common land between
the houses, but not the houses themselves.
 Each of these groups takes responsibility for those
patterns relevant to its own internal structure.
Thus, we imagine, for example, that the various

TOWNS
groups we have named might choose to adopt the following
patterns:
A. Region: INDEPENDENT REGIONS
DISTRIBUTION OF TOWNS
CITY COUNTRY FINGERS •
B. City: MOSAIC OF SUBCULTURES
SCATTERED WORK
THE MAGIC OF THE CITY
C. Community: COMMUNITY OF 000
SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY
 Each neighborhood, community, or city is then
free to find various ways of persuading its constituent
groups and individuals to implement these patterns
gradually.
In every case this will hinge on some kind of incentive.
However, the actual incentives chosen might vary
greatly, in their power, and degree of enforcement.
Some patterns, like CITY COUNTRY FINGERS, might be
made a matter of regional law-since nothing less can
deter money-hungry developers from building everywhere.
Other patterns, like MAIN GATEWAY, BIRTH
PLACES, STILL WATER, might be purely voluntary. And
other patterns might have various kinds of incentives,
intermediate between these extremes.
For example, NETWORK OF PATHS AND CARS, ACCESSIBLE
GREENS, and others might be formulated so that
tax breaks will be given to those development projects
which help to bring them into existence.
 As far as possible, implementation should be loose
and voluntary, based on social responsibility, and not on
legislation or coercion.
Suppose, for example, that there is a citywide decision
TOWNS
to increase industrial uses in certain areas. Within the
process here defined, the city could riot implement this
policy over the heads of the neighborhoods, by zoning
or the power of eminent domain or any other actions.
They can suggest that it is important, and can increase
the Bow of money to any neighborhoods willing to help
implement this larger pattern. They can implement it,
in short, if they can find local neighborhoods willing to
see their own future in these terms, and willing to modify
their own environment to help make it happen locally.
As they find such neighborhoods, then it will
happen gradually, over a period of years, as the local
neighborhoods respond to the incentives.
 Once such a process is rolling, a community, having
adopted the pattern HEALTH CENTER, for example,
might invite a group of doctors to come and build such
a place. The team of users, designing the clinic would
work from the HEALTH CENTER pattern, and all the
other relevant patterns that are part of the community's
language. They would try to build into their project any
higher patterns that the community has adopted-NINE
PER CENT PARKING, LOCAL SPORTS, NETWORK OF PATHS
ANDC ARSA, CCESSIBLGER EEN,e tc.
 It is of course possible for individual acts of building
to begin working their way toward these larger communal
patterns, even before the neighborhood, community,
and regional groups are formed.
Thus, for example, a group of people seeking to get
rid of noisy and dangerous traffic in front of their houses
might decide to tear up the asphalt, and build a GREEN
STREET there instead. They would present their case to

TOWNS
the traffic department based on the arguments presented
in the pattern, and on an analysis of the existing street
pattern.
Another group wanting to build a small communal
workshop, in a neighborhood currently zoned for residential
use only, can argue their case based on SCATTERED
WORK, SETTLED WORK, etc., and possibly get the city or
zoning department to change the zoning regulation on
this matter, and thereby slowly work toward introducing
patterns, one at a time within the current framework of
codes and zoning.
We have worked out a partial version of this process
at the Eugene campus of the University of Oregon.
That work is described in Volume , The Oregon Experiment.
But a university is quite different from a town,
because it has a single centralized owner, and a single
source of funds. It is inevitable, therefore, that the
process by which individual acts can work together to
form larger wholes without restrictive planning from
above, can only partly be put into practice there.
The theory which explains how large patterns can be
built piecemeal from smaller ones, is given in Chapters
 and  of The Timeless Way of Building.
At some time in the future, we hope to write another
volume, which explains the political and economic processes
needed to implement this process fully, in a town.


Do what you can to establish a world government,
with a thousand independent regions, instead of
countries;
I. INDEPENDENT REGIONS
I INDEPENDENT REGIONS**

Metropolitan regions will not come to balance until each
one is small and autonomous enough to be an independent
sphere of culture.
There are four separate arguments which have led us to this
conclusion: I. The nature and limits of human government. .
Equity among regions in a world community. . Regional planning
considerations. . Support for the intensity and diversity of
human cultures.
I. There are natural limits to the size of groups that can govern
themselves in a human way. The biologist J. B. S. Haldane
has remarked on this in his paper, "On Being the Right Size":
... just as there is a best size for every animal, so the same is
true for every human institution. In the Greek type of democracy
all the citizens could listen to a series of orators and vote directly on
questions of legislation. Hence their philosophers held that a small
city was the largest possible democratic state .... J. B. S Haldane,
"On Being the Right Size," The W odd of Mathematics, Vol. II,
J. R. Newman, ed. New York: Simon and Schuster, 56, pp. 62-
67).
It is not hard to see why the government of a region becomes
less and less manageable with size. In a population of N persons,
there are of the order of N person-to-person links needed to keep
channels of communication open. Naturally, when N goes beyond
a certain limit, the channels of communication needed for democracy
and justice and information are simply too clogged, and
too complex; bureaucracy overwhelms human processes.
And, of course, as N grows the number of levels in the hierarchy
of government increases too. In small countries like Denmark
there are so few levels, that any private citizen can have
access to the Minister of Education. But this kind of direct access
is quite impossible in larger countries like England or the United
States.
We believe the limits are reached when the population of a
region reaches some  to IO million. Beyond this size, people become
remote from the large-scale processes of government. Our
estimate may seem extraordinary in the light of modern history:
the nation-states have grown mightily and their governments hold
power over tens of millions, sometimes hundreds of millions, of
people. But these huge powers cannot claim to have a natural size.
II
TOWNS
They cannot claim to have struck the balance between the needs
of towns and communities, and the needs of the world community
as a whole. Indeed, their tendency has been to override local
needs and repress local culture, and at the same time aggrandize
themselves to the point where they are out of reach, their power
barely conceivable to the average citizen.
 Unless a region has at least several million people in it, it
will not be large enough to have a seat in a world government,
and will therefore not be able to supplant the power and authority
of present nation-states.
We found this point expressed by Lord Weymouth of Warminster,
England, in a letter to the New York Times, March I ,
1973:
WORLD FEDERATION: A THOUSAND STATES
the essential foundation stone for world federation on a democratic
basis consists of regionalization within centralized government
.... This argument rests on the idea that world government
is lacking in moral authority unless each delegate represents an
approximately equal portion of the world's population. Working
backward from an estimate of the global population in the year
2000, which is anticipated to rise to the 0, million mark, I
suggest that we should be thinking in terms of an ideal regional
state at something around ten million, or between five and fifteen
million, to give greater flexibility. This would furnish the U.N. with
an assembly of equals of  ooo regional representatives: a body that
would be justified in claiming to be truly representative of the
world's population.
Weymouth believes that Western Europe could take some of
the initiative for triggering this conception of world government.
He looks for the movement for regional autonomy to take hold in
the European Parliament at Strasbourg; and hopes that power can
gradually be transferred from Westminister, Paris, Bonn, etc., to
regional councils, federated in Strasbourg.
I am suggesting that in the Europe of the future we shall see
England split down into Kent, Wessex, Mercia, Anglia and Northumbria,
with an independent Scotland, Wales and Ireland, of
course. Other European examples will include Brittany, Bavaria and
Calabria. The national identities of our contemporary Europe will
have lost their political significance.
 Unless the regions have the power to be self-governing, they

I INDEPENDENT REGIONS
will not be able to solve their own environmental problems. The
arbitrary lines of states and countries, which often cut across
natural regional boundaries, make it all but impo$sible for people
to solve regional problems in a direct and humanly efficient way.
An extensive and detailed analysis of this idea has been given
by the French economist Gravier, who has proposed, in a series of
books and papers, the concept of a Europe of the Regions, a
Europe decentralized and reorganized around regions which cross
present national and subnational boundaries. For example, the
Basel-Strasbourg Region includes parts of France, Germany, and
Switzerland; the Liverpool Region includes parts of England
and parts of Wales). See Jean-Fran ois Gravier, "L'Europe des
regions," in I   Internationale Regio Planertagung, Schriften
der Regio , Regio, Basel, I 65, pp. 11-22; and in the same
volume see also Emrys Jones, "The Conflict of City Regions and
Administrative Units in Britain," pp.  - .
 Finally, unless the present-day great nations have their
power greatly decentralized, the beautiful and differentiated languages,
cultures, customs, and ways of life of the earth's people,
vital to the health of the planet, will vanish. In short, we believe
that independent regions are the natural receptacles for language,
culture, customs, economy, and laws and that each region should
be separate and independent enough to maintain the strength and
vigor of its culture.
The fact that human cultures within a city can only flourish
when they are at least partly separated from neighboring cultures
is discussed in great detail in MOSAIC OF SUBCULTURES ). We
are suggesting here that the same argument also applies to regions
-that the regions of the earth must also keep their distance and
their dignity in order to survive as cultures.
In the best of medieval times, the cities performed this function.
They provided permanent and intense spheres of cultural influence,
variety, and economic exchange; they were great communes,
whose citizens were co-members, each with some say in the city's
destiny. We believe that the independent region can become the
modern polis-the new commune-that human entity which
provides the sphere of culture, language, laws, services, economic
exchange, variety, which the old walled city or the polis provided
for its members.

TOWNS
Therefore:
Wherever possible, work toward the evolution of independent
regions in the world; each with a population between
 and ro million; each with its own natural and
geographic boundaries; each with its own economy; each
one autonomous and self-governing; each with a seat in
a world government, without the intervening power of
larger states or countries.

within each region work toward those regional
policies which will protect the land and mark the
limits of the cities :

 THE DISTRIBUTION
OF TOWNS

I
... consider now the character of settlements within the region:
what balance of villages, towns, and cities is in keeping with the
independence of the region-INDEPENDENT REGIONS I /
If the population of a region is weighted too far toward
small villages, modern civilization can never emerge; but
if the population is weighted too far toward big cities,
the earth will go to ruin because the population isn't where
it needs to be, to take care of it.
Two different necessities govern the distribution of population
in a region. On the one hand, people are drawn to cities: they are
drawn by the growth of civilization, jobs, education, economic
growth, information. On the other hand, the region as a social
and ecological whole will not be properly maintained unless the
people of the region are fairly well spread out across it, living in
many different kinds of settlements-farms, villages, towns, and
cities-with each settlement taking care of the land around it.
Industrial society has so far been following only the first of these
necessities. People leave the farms and towns and villages and pack
into the cities, leaving vast parts of the region depopulated and
undermaintained.
In order to establish a reasonable distribution of population
within a region, we must fix two separate features of the distribution:
its statistical character and its spatial character. First, we
must be sure that the statistical distribution of towns, by size, is
appropriate: we must be sure that there are many small towns and
few large ones. Second, we must then be sure that the spatial distribution
of towns within the region is appropriate: we must be
sure that the towns in any given size category are evenly spread
out across the region, not highly concentrated.
In practice, the statistical distribution will take care of itself.
A large number of studies has shown that the natural demographic
and political and economic processes at work in city
growth and population movement will create a distribution of

TOWNS
towns with many small towns and few large ones; and indeed, the
nature of this distribution does correspond, roughly, to the logarithmic
distribution that we propose in this pattern. Various explanations
have been given by Christaller, Zipf, Herbert Simon,
and others; they are summarized in Brian Berry and William
Garrison, "Alternate Explanations of Urban Rank-Size Relationships,"
Annals of the Association of American Geographers, Vol.
48, March 58, No. , pp. 3-91.
Let us assume, then, that towns will have the right distribution
of sizes. But are they adjacent to one another, or are they spread
outr If all the towns in a region, large, medium, and small, were
crammed together in one continuous urban area, the fact that
some are large and some are small, though interesting politically,
would have no ecological meaning whatsoever. As far as the
ecology of the region is concerned, it is the spatial distribution
of the towns which matters, not the statistics of political boundaries
within the urban sprawl.
Two arguments have led us to propose that the towns in any
one size category should be uniformly distributed across the region:
an economic argument and an ecological argument.
Economic. All over the world, underdeveloped areas are facing
economic ruin because the jobs, and then the people, move toward
the largest cities, under the influence of their economic gravity.
Sweden, Scotland, Israel, and Mexico are all examples. The population
moves toward Stockholm, Glasgow, Tel Aviv, Mexico City
-as it does so, new jobs get created in the city, and then even
more people have to come to the city in search of jobs. Gradually
the imbalance between city and country becomes severe. The city
becomes richer, the outlying areas continuously poorer. In the
end the region may have the highest standard of living in the
world at its center, yet only a few miles away, at its periphery,
people may be starving.
This can only be halted by policies which guarantee an equal
sharing of resources, and economic development, across the entire
region. In Israel, for example, there has been some attempt
to pour the limited resources with which the government can
subsidize economic growth into those areas which are most
backward economically. See "Urban Growth Policies in Six

 THE DISTRIBUTION OF TOWNS
European Countries," Urban Growth Policy Study Group, Office
of International Affairs, HUD, Washington, D.C., 72.)
Ecological. An overconcentrated population, in space, puts a
huge burden on the region's overall ecosystem. As the big cities
grow, the population movement overburdens these areas with air
pollution, strangled transportation, water shortages, housing shortages,
and living densities which go beyond the realm of human
reasonableness. In some metropolitan centers, the ecology is perilously
close to cracking. By contrast, a population that is spread
more evenly over its region minimizes its impact on the ecology
of the environment, and finds that it can take care of itself and
the land more prudently, with less waste and more humanity:
This is because the actual urban superstructure required per inhabitant
goes up radically as the size of the town increases beyond a
certain point. For example, the per capita cost of high rise flats is
much greater than that of ordinary houses; and the cost of roads
and other transportation routes increases with the number of commuters
carried. Similarly, the per capita expenditure on other facilities
such as those for distributing food and removing wastes is
much higher in cities than in small towns and villages. Thus, if
everybody lived in villages the need for sewage treatment plants
would be somewhat reduced, while in an entireJy urban society they
are essential, and the cost of treatment is high. Broadly speaking, it
is only by decentralization that we can increase self-sufficiencyand
self-sufficiency is vital if we are to minimize the burden of social
systems on the ecosystems that support them. The Ecologist, Blueprint
for Survival, England: Penguin, 72, pp. 2-53.)
Therefore:
Encourage a birth and death process for towns within
the region, which gradually has these effects:
I. The population is evenly distributed in terms of different
sizes-for example, one town with ,000, people,
IO towns with 00, people each,  towns with
10, people each, and  towns with  people
each.
 These towns are distributed in space in such a way
that within each size category the towns are homogeneously
distributed all across the region.

TOWNS
This process can be implemented by regional zoning
policies, land grants, and incentives which encourage industries
to locate according to the dictates of the distribution.

As the distribution evolves, protect the prime agricultural land
for farming-AGRICULTURAL VALLEYS ); protect the smaller
outlying towns, by establishing belts of countryside around them
and by decentralizing industry, so that the towns are economically
stable-coUNTRY TOWNS  ). In the larger more central urban
areas work toward land policies which maintain open belts of
countryside between the belts of city-CITY COUNTRY FINGERS
(3 ...

 CITY COUNTRY FINGERS**

... the distribution of towns required to make a balanced region-
DISTRIBUTION OF TOWNS )-can be further helped by
controlling the balance of urban land and open countryside within
the towns and cities themselves.
Continuous sprawling urbanization destroys life, and
makes cities unbearable. But the sheer size of cities is also
valuable and potent.
People feel comfortable when they have access to the countryside,
experience of open fields, and agriculture; access to wild
plants and birds and animals. For this access, cities must have
boundaries with the countryside near every point. At the same time,
a city becomes good for life only when it contains a great density
of interactions among people and work, and different ways of life.
For the sake of this interaction, the city must be continuous-not
broken up. In this pattern we shall try to bring these two facts
to balance.
Let us begin with the fact that people living in cities need
contact with true rural land to maintain their roots with the
land that supports them. A  Gallup poll gives very strong
evidence for this fact. The poll asked the question: "If you could
Jive anywhere, would you prefer a city, suburban area, small
town, or farm?" and received the following answers from I
Americans:
City %
Suburb
Small town 2
Farm
And this dissatisfaction with cities is getting worse. In 66, 2
percent said they preferred the city-in 72, only six years
later, this figure dropped to I  percent. "Most don't want to
live in a city," George Gallup, San Francisco Chronicle, Monday,
December , 72, p. .)
It is easy to understand why city people long for contact with

 CITY COUNTRY FINGERS
the countryside. Only IOO years ago  percent of the Americans
lived on rural land; today  percent live in cities. Apparently
we cannot live entirely within cities-at least the kinds
of cities we have built so far-our need for contact with the
countryside runs too deep, it is a biological necessity:
Unique as we may think we are, we are nevertheless as likely to
be genetically programmed to a natural habitat of clean air and a
varied green landscape as any other mammal. To be relaxed and
feel healthy usually means simply allowing our bodies to react in
the way for which one hundred millions of years of evolution has
equipped us. Physically and genetically, we appear best adapted to a
tropical savanna, but as a cultural animal we utilize learned adaptations
to cities and towns. For thousands of years we have tried in our
houses to imitate not only the climate, but the setting of our evolutionary
past: warm, humid air, green plants, and even animal companions.
Today, if we can afford it, we may even build a greenhouse
or swimming pool next to our living room, buy a place in the
country, or at least take our children vacationing on the seashore.
The specific physiological reactions to natural beauty and diversity,
to the shapes and colors of nature especially to green), to the motions
and sounds of other animals, such as birds, we as yet do not
comprehend. But it is evident that nature in our daily life should be
thought of as a part of the biological need. It cannot be neglected in
the discussions of resource policy for man. H. H. Iltis, P. Andres,
and 0. L. Loucks, in Population Resources Environment: [smes in
Human Ecology, P. R. Ehrlich and A. H. Ehrlich, San Francisco:
Freeman and Co., 70, p. 04.)
But it is becoming increasingly difficult for city dwellers to
come into contact with rural life. In the San Francisco Bay
Region  I square miles of open space is lost each year  Gerald D.
Adams, "The Open Space Explosion," Cry California, Fall 70,
pp. -32. As cities get bigger the rural land is farther and
farther away.
With the breakdown of contact between city dwellers and the
countryside, the cities become prisons. Farm vacations, a year on
the farm for city children, and retirement to the country for old
people are replaced by expensive resorts, summer camps, and retirement
villages. And for most, the only contact remaining is the
weekend exodus from the city, choking the highways and the few
organized recreation centers. Many weekenders return to the
city on Sunday night with their nerves more shattered than when
they left.
TOWNS
W /,en the countryside is far away
the city becomes a prison.
If we wish to re-establish and maintain the proper connection
between city and country, and yet maintain the density of urban
interactions, it will be necessary to stretch out the urbanized area
into long sinuous lingers which extend into the farmland, shown
in the diagram below. Not only will the city be in, the form of
narrow lingers, but so will the farmlands adjacent to it.
The maximum width of the city lingers is determined by the
maximum acceptable distance from the heart of the city to the
countryside. We reckon that everyone should be within IO minutes'
walk of the countryside. This would set a maximum width
of I mile for the city fingers.
The minimum for any farmland finger is determined by the
minimum acceptable dimensions for typical working farms. Since
 percent of all farms are still  acres or less and there is no
respectable evidence that the giant farm is more efficient Leon
H. Keyserling, Agriculture and the Public lntere1t, Conference on
Economic Progress, Washington, D. C., February I 65), these
fingers of farmland need be no more than I mile wide.
The implementation of this pattern requires new policies of
three different kinds. With respect to the farmland, there must
be policies encouraging the reconstruction of small farms, farms
that fit the one-mile bands of country land. Second, there must
be policies which contain the cities' tendency to scatter in every
direction. And third, the countryside must be truly public, so
that people can establish contact with even those parts of the land
that are under private cultivation.
Imagine how this one pattern would transform life in cities.
J CITY COUNTRY FINGERS
Every city dweller would have access to the countryside; the open
country would be a half-hour bicycle ride from downtown.
Therefore:
Keep interlocking fingers of farmland and urban land,
even at the center of the metropolis. The urban fingers
should never be more than I mile wide, while the farmland
fingers should never be less than I mile wide.
city fingers,
at most I mile wide

Whenever land is hilly, keep the country fingers in the valleys
and the city fingers on the upper slopes of hillsides-AGRICULTURAL
VALLEYS  ). Break the city fingers into hundreds of distinct
self-governing subcultures-MOSAIC OF SUBCULTURES ),
and run the major roads and railways down the middle of these
city fingers-WEB OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION r6), RING ROADS
( I ). . . .

 AGRICULTURAL VALLEYS*

... this pattern helps maintain the INDEPENDENT REGIONS I)
by making regions more self-sufficient agriculturally; and it will
create CITY COUNTRY FINGERS   almost automatically by preserving
agricultural land in urban areas. But just exactly which
land ought to be preserved, and which land built upon/

The land which is best for agriculture happens to be best
for building too. But it is limited-and once destroyed, it
cannot be regained for centuries.
In the last few years, suburban growth has been spreading
over all land, agricultural or not. It eats up this limited resource
and, worse still, destroys the possibility of farming close to cities
once and for all. But we know, from the arguments of CITY
COUNTRY FINGERS ), that it is important to have open farmland
near the places where people live. Since the arable land
which can be used for farming I ies mainly in the valleys, it is
essential that the valley floors within our urban regions be left untouched
and kept for farming.
The most complete study of this problem that we know, comes
from Ian McHarg Design With Nature, New York: Natural
History Press, 69). In his "Plan for the Valleys" WallaceMcHarg
Associates, Philadelphia, I 63), he shows how town
development can be diverted to the hillsides and plateaus, leaving
the valleys clear. The pattern is supported, also, by the fact that
there are several possible practical approaches to the task of
implementation McHarg, pp. -93).
Therefore:
Preserve all agricultural valleys as farmland and protect
this land from any development which would destroy or
lock up the unique fertility of the soil. Even when valleys

are not cultivated now, protect them: keep them for farms
and parks and wilds.
hills for building

Keep town and city development along the hilltops and hillsides-
CITY COUNTRY FINGERS  ). And in the valleys, treat
the ownership of the land as a form of stewardship, embracing
basic ecological responsibilities-THE COUNTRYSIDE   ....

 LACE OF COUNTRY
STREETS
... according to the pattern CITY COUNTRY FINGERS  ), there
is a rather sharp division between city land and rural land. But
at the ends of city fingers, where the country fingers open out,
there is a need for an additional kind of structure. This structure
has traditionally been the suburbs. But. ..

The suburb is an obsolete and contradictory form of human
settlement.
Many people want to live in the country; and they also want
to be close to a large city. But it is geometrically impossible to
have thousands of small farms, within a few minutes of a major
city center.
To live well in the country, you must have a reasonable piece
of land of your own-large enough for horses, cows, chickens, an
orchard-and you must have immediate access to continuous
open countryside, as far as the eye can see. To have quick access
to the city, you must live on a road, within a few minutes' drive
from city centers, and with a bus line outside your door.
It is possible to have both, by arranging country roads around
large open squares of countryside or farmland, with houses closely
packed along the road, but only one house deep. Lionel March
lends support to this pattern in his paper, "Homes beyond the
Fringe" Land Use and Built Form Studies, Cambridge, England,
1968). March shows that such a pattern, fully developed, could
work for millions of people even in a country as small and densely
populated as England.
A "lace of country streets" contains square miles of open
countryside, fast roads from the city at the edge of these square
miles, houses clustered along the roads, and footpaths stretching
out from the city, crisscrossing the countryside.
I. Square miles of open countrysiC:  . We believe that one
square mile is the smallest piece of open land which still maintains
the integrity of the countryside. This figure is derived from
the requirements of small farms, presented in the argument for
CITY COUNTRY FINGERS ),

 LACE OF COUNTRY STREETS
 Roads. To protect the countryside from suburban encroachment,
the roads running out into the countryside must be vastly
reduced in number. A loose network of interconnected roads,
at one-mile intervals with little encouragement for throughtraflic
to pass through them, is quite enough.
 Lots. Situate homesteads, houses, and cottages along these
country roads one or two lots deep, always setting them off the
road with the open land behind them. The minimum land for a
homestead must be approximately one-half acre to allow for basic
farming. However, some of the housing could be in rows or
clusters, with people working the land behind collectively. Assuming
one-half acre lots around a one mile square of open land, we
can have  households to the square mile. With four people per
household, that is I  people per square mi le; not very different
from an ordinary low density suburb.
 Footpaths. The countryside can be made accessible to city
people by means of footpaths and trails running from the edge of
the city and from the country roads into the countryside, across
the squares of open land.
Therefore:
In the zone where city and country meet, place country
roads at least a mile apart, so that they enclose squares of
countryside and farmland at least one square mile in area.
Build homesteads along these roads, one lot deep, on lots
of at least half an acre, with the square mile of open countryside
or farmland behind the houses.

 COUNTRY TOWNS*

... this pattern forms the backbone of the DISTRIBUTION OF
TOWNS  ), which requires that scores of smaller country towns
support the larger towns and cities of the region.

The big city is a magnet. It is terribly hard for small
towns to stay alive and healthy in the face of central urban
growth.
During the last  years,  million rural Americans have
been forced to leave their farms and small towns and migrate
to crowded cities. This forced migration continues at the rate
of 00, people a year, The families that are left behind
are not able to count on a future living in the country: about
half of them live on less than $  a year.
And it is not purely the search for jobs that has led people
away from small towns to the cities. It is also a search for information,
for connection to the popular culture. In Ireland and India,
for example, lively people leave the villages where there is some
work, and some little food, and they go to the city, looking for
action, for better work, for a better life.
Unless steps are taken to recharge the life of country towns, the
cities will swamp those towns which lie the nearest to them; and
will rob those which lie furthest out of their most vigorous rnhabitants.
What are the possibilities?
I. Economic reconstruction. Incentives to business and Industry
to decentralize and locate in small towns. Incentives to
the inhabitants of small towns to begin grassroots business and
production ventures. See, for example, the bill introduced by
Joe Evins in the House of Representatives, Congressional Record
-House, October , 67, 687.)
 Zoning. Zoning policy to protect small towns and the
countryside around them. Greenbelt zoning was defined by
Ebenezer Howard at the turn of the century and has yet to be
taken seriously by American governments.
 Social services. There are connections between small towns

 COUNTRY TOWNS
and cities that take the form of social services, that are irreplaceable:
small town visits, farm weekends and vacations for city
dwellers, schools and camps in the countryside for city children,
small town retirement for old people who do not like the pace
of city life. Let the city invite small towns to provide these
services, as grassroots ventures, and the city, or private groups, will
pay for the cost of the service.
Therefore:
Preserve country towns where they exist; and encourage
the growth of new self-contained towns, with populations
between  and 0,000, entirely surrounded by open countryside
and at least IO miles from neighboring towns. Make
it the region's collective concern to give each town the
wherewithal it needs to build a base of local industry, so
that these towns are not dormitories for people who work
in other places, but real towns-able to sustain the whole
of life.

Treat each of these small towns as a political community, with
full provision for all the stages of human life-COMMUNITY OF

which surrounds the town as farm land which belongs to the
people and can be freely used by them-THE COUNTRYSIDE
(  ....

 THE COUNTRYSIDE*
... within each region, in between the towns, there are vast
areas of countryside-farmland, parkland, forests, deserts, grazing
meadows, lakes, and rivers. The legal and ecological character of
this countryside is crucial to the balance of the region. When
properly done, this pattern will help to complete THE DISTRIBUTION
OF TOWNS ), CITY COUNTRY FINGERS ), AGRICULTURAL

I conceive that land belongs for use to a vast family of
which many are dead, few are living, and countless members
are still unborn.
-a Nigerian tribesman
Parks are dead and artificial. Farms, when treated as private
property, rob the people of their natural biological heritage-the
countryside from which they came.
Property is theft
In Norway, England, Austria, it is commonly understood that
people have a right to picnic in farmland, and walk and playprovided
they respect the animals and crops. And the reverse is
also true-there is no wilderness which is abandoned to its own
processes-even the mountainsides are terraced, mown, and
grazed and cared for.
We may summarize these ideas by saying that there is only one
kind of non urban land-the countryside. There are no parks;

TOWNS
no farms; no uncharted wilderness. Every piece of countryside
has keepers who have the right to farm it, if it is arable; or the
obligation to look after it, if it is wild; and every piece of land
is open to the people at large, provided they respect the organic
processes which are going on there.
The central conception behind this view of the land is
given by Aldo Leopold in his essay, "The Land Ethic" A Sand
County Almanac, New York: Oxford University Press, 49);
Leopold believes that our relationship to the land will provide the
framework for the next great ethical transformation in the human
community:
This extension of ethics, so far studied only by philosophers, is
actually a process in ecological evolution. Its sequences may be
described in ecological as well as in philosophical terms. An ethic,
ecologically, is a limitation on freedom of action in the struggle for
existence. An ethic, philosophically, is a differentiation of social from
anti-social conduct. These are two definitions of one thing. The thing
has its origin in the tendency of interdependent individuals or groups
to evol vc modes of co-operation. The ecologist calls these symbioses.
Politics and economics are advanced symbioses in which the original
free-for-all competition has been replaced, in part, by co-operative
mechanisms with an ethical content. ...
All ethics so far evolved rest upon a single premise: that the individual
is a member of a community of interdependent parts. His
instincts prompt him to compete for his place in that community, but
his ethics prompt him also to co-operate ....
The land ethic simply enlarges the boundaries of the community
to include soils, waters, plants, and animals, or collectively: the
land ....
Within the framework of this ethic, parks and campgrounds
conceived as "pieces of nature" for people's recreation, without
regard for the intrinsic value of the land itself, are dead things
and immoral. So also are farms conceived as areas "owned" by
the farmers for their own exclusive profit. If we continue to
treat the land as an instrument for our enjoyment, and as a
source of economic profit, our parks and camps will become more
artificial, more plastic, more like Disneyland. And our farms will
become more and more like factories. The land ethic replaces the
idea of public parks and public campgrounds with the concept
of a single countryside.
I
 THE COUNTRYSIDE
One example of support for this idea lies in the Blueprint for
Survival, and the proposal there to give traditional communities
stewardship over certain estuaries and marshes. These wetlands
are the spawning grounds for the fish and shellfish which form
the base of the food chain for  per cent of the entire ocean
harvest, and they can only be properly managed by a group who
respects them as a cooperating part in the chain of life. The
Ecologist, England: Penguin, 72, p. 1.)
The residential forests of Japan provide another example. A
village grows up along the edge of a forest; the villagers tend
the forest. Thinning it properly is one of their responsibilities.
The forest is available to anyone who wants to come there and
partake in the process:
The farmhouses of Kurume-machi stand in a row along the main
road for about a mile. Each house is surrounded by a belt of trees of
similar species, giving the aspect of a single large forest. The main
trees are located so as to produce a shelter-belt. In addition, these
small forests are homes for birds, a device for conserving water, a
source of firewood and timber, which is selectively cut, and a
means of climate control, since the temperature inside the residential
forest is cooler in summer and warmer in winter.
It should be noted that these residential forests, established more
than  years ago, are still intact as a result of the careful selective
cutting and replacement program followed by the residents. John
L. Creech, "Japan-Like a National Park," Yearbook of A griculture
1963, U.S. Department of Agriculture, pp. 25-28.)
Therefore:
Define all farms as parks, where the public has a right to
be; and make all regional parks into working farms.
Create stewardships among groups of people, families and
cooperatives, with each stewardship responsible for one
part of the countryside. The stewards are given a lease for
the land, and they are free to tend the land and set ground
rules for its use-as a small farm, a forest, marshland, desert,
and so forth. The public is free to visit the land, hike
there, picnic, explore, boat, so long as they conform to the
ground rules. With such a setup, a farm near a city might
have picnickers in its fields every day during the summer.

... the most basic structure of a city is given by the relation of
urban land to open country-c1TY COUNTRY FINGERS  ). Within
the swaths of urban land the most important structure must come
from the great variety of human groups and subcultures which
can co-exist there.

The homogeneous and undifferentiated character of
modern cities kills all variety of life styles and arrests the
growth of individual character.
Compare three possible alternative ways m which people may
be distributed throughout the city:
I. In the heterogeneous city, people are mixed together, irrespective
of their life style or culture. This seems rich. Actually
it dampens all significant variety, arrests most of the possibilities
for differentiation, and encourages conformity. It tends to reduce
all life styles to a common denominator. What appears heterogeneous
turns out to be homogeneous and dull.

 In a city made up of ghettos, people have the support of
the most basic and banal forms of differentiation-race or economic
status. The ghettos are still homogeneous internally, and

do not allow a significant variety of life styles to emerge. People
in the ghetto are usually forced to live there, isolated from the
rest of society, unable to evolve their way of life, and often intolerant
of ways of life different from their own.
 In a city made of a large number of subcultures relatively
small in size, each occupying an identifiable place and separated
from other subcultures by a boundary of nonresidential land,
new ways of life can develop. People can choose the kind of subculture
they wish to live in, and can still experience many ways
of life different from their own. Since each environment fosters
mutual support and a strong sense of shared values, individuals
can grow.
Mosaic of subcultures.
This pattern for a mosaic of subcultures was originally proposed
by Frank Hendricks. His latest paper dealing with it is "Concepts
of environmental quality standards based on life styles,"
with Malcolm MacNair Pittsburg, Pennsylvania: University of
Pittsburgh, February 69). The psychological needs which underlie
this pattern and which make it necessary for subcultures to
be spatially separated in order to thrive have been described by
Christopher Alexander, "Mosaic of Subcultures," Center for Environmental
Structure, Berkeley, I 68. The following statement
is an excerpt from that paper.

 MOSAIC OF SUBCULTURES
Many of the people who live in metropolitan areas have a weak
character. In fact, metropolitan areas seem almost marked by the
fact that the people in them have markedly weak character, compared
with the character which develops in simpler and more rugged
situations. This weakness of character is the counterpart of another,
far more visible feature of metropolitan areas: the homogeneity and
lack of variety among the people who live there. Of course, weakness
of character and lack of variety, are simply two sides of the
same coin: a condition in which people have relatively undifferentiated
selves. Character can only occur in a self which is strongly
differentiated and whole: by definition, a society where people are
relatively homogeneous, is one where individual selves are not
strongly differentiated.
Let us begin with the problem of variety. The idea of men as
millions of faceless nameless cogs pervades 0th century literature.
The nature of modern housing reflects this image and sustains it. The
vast majority of housing built today has the touch of mass-production.
Adjacent apartments are identical. Adjacent houses are identical.
The most devastating image of all was a photograph published in
Life magazine several years ago as an advertisement for a timber
company: The photograph showed a huge roomful of people; all of
them had exactly the same face. The caption underneath explained:
In honor of the chairman's birthday, the shareholders of the corporation
are wearing masks made from his face.
These are no more than images and indications .... But where
do all the frightening images of sameness, human digits, and human
cogs, come from? Why have Kafka and Camus and Sartre spoken to
our hearts?
Many writers have answered this question in detail-[David Riesman
in The Lonely Crowd; Kurt Goldstein in The Organism; Max
Wertheimer in The Story of T ,,-ee Days; Abraham Maslow in
Motivation and Personality; Rollo May in Man's Search for Himself,
etc.]. Their answers all converge on the following essential
point: Although a person may have a different mixture of attributes
from his neighbour, he is not truly different, until he has a strong
center, until his uniqueness is integrated and forceful. At present, in
metropolitan areas, this seems not to be the case. Different though
they are in detail, people are forever leaning on one another, trying
to be whatever will not displease the others, afraid of being themselves.
People do things a certain way "because that's the way to get them
done" instead of "because we believe them right." Compromise,
going along with the others, the spirit of committees and all that it
implies-in metropolitan areas, these characteristics have been made
to appear adult, mature, well-adjusted. But euphemisms do little to
disguise the fact that people who do things because that's the way
to get along with others, instead of doing what they believe in, do it
because it avoids coming to terms with their own self, and standing

TOWNS
on it, and confronting others with it. It is easy to defend this weakness
of character on the grounds of expediency. But however many
excuses are made for it, in the end weakness of character destroys a
person; no one weak in character can love himself. The self-hate that
it creates is not a condition in which a person can become whole.
By contrast, the person who becomes whole, states his own nature,
visibly, and outwardly, loud and clear, for everyone to see. He is
not afraid of his own self; he stands up for what he is; he is himself,
proud of himself, recognising his shortcomings, trying to
change them, but still proud of himself and glad to be himself.
But it is hard to allow that you which lurks beneath the surface
to come out and show itself. It is so much easier to live according to
the ideas of life which have been laid down by others, to bend your
true self to the whee of custom, to hide yourself in demands which
are not yours, and which do not leave you full.
It seems clear, then, that variety, character, and finding your own
self, are closely interwoven. In a society where a man can find his
own self, there will be ample variety of character, and character will
be strong. In a society where people have trouble finding their own
selves, people will seem homogeneous, there will be less variety, and
character will be weak.
If it is true that character is weak in metropolitan areas today,
and we want to do something about it, the first thing we must do, is
to understand hoo.v the metropolis has this effect.
II.
How does a metropolis create conditions ,n which people find it
hard to find themselves/
We know that the individual forms his own self out of the values,
habits and beliefs, and attitudes which his society presents him with.
[George Herbert Mead, Mind, Self and Society.] In a metropolis the
individual is confronted by a vast tableau of different values, habits
and beliefs and attitudes. Whereas, in a primitive society, he had
merely to integrate the traditional beliefs in a sense, there was a
self already there for the asking), in modern society each person has
literally to fabricate a self, for himself, out of the chaos of values
which surrounds him.
If, every day you do something, you meet someone with a slightly
different background, and each of these peoples' response to what
yon do is different even when your actions are the same, the situation
becomes more and more confusing. The possibility that you can
become secure and strong in yourself, certain of what you are, and
certain of what you are doing, goes down radically. Faced constantly
with an unpredictable changing social world, people no longer
generate the strength to draw on themselves; they draw more and
more on the approval of others; they look to see whether people are
smiling when they say something, and if they are, they go on saying
 MOSAIC OF SUBCULTURES
it, and if not, they shut up. In a world like that, it is very hard for
anyone to establish any sort of inner strength.
Once we accept the idea that the formation of the self is a social
process, it becomes clear that the formation of a strong social self
depends on the strength of the surrounding social order. When attitudes,
values, beliefs and habits are highly diffuse and mixed up as
they are in a metropolis, it is almost inevitable that the person who
grows up in these conditions will be diffuse and mixed up too. Weak
character is a direct product of the present metropolitan society.
This argument has been summarized in devastating terms by
Margaret Mead [Culture, Change and Character Structm·e]. A m11nber
of writers have supported this view empirically: Hartshorne,
H. and May, M. A., Studies in the Nature of Character, New York,
Macmillan,  ; and "A Summary of the Work of the Character
Education Inquiry," Religiou.< Education, 30, Vol. , 07-619
and  4-762. "Contradictory demands made upon the child in the
varied situations in which he is responsible to adults, not only prevent
the organisation of a consistent character, but actually compel
inconsistency as the price of peace and self-respect." ...
But this is not the end of the story. So far we have seen how the
diffusion of a metropolis creates weak character. But diffusion, when
it becomes pronounced, creates a special kind of superficial uniformity.
When many colors are mixed, in many tiny scrambled bits
and pieces, the overall effect is grey. This greyness helps to create
weak character in its own way.
In a society where there are many voices, and many values,
people cling to those few things which they all have in common. Thus
Margaret Mead  op. cit. : "There is a tendency to reduce all
values to simple scales of dollars, school grades, or some other
simple quantitative measure, whereby the extreme incommensurables
of many different sets of cultural values can be easily, though superficially,
reconciled." And Joseph T. Klapper [The Effects of Mass
Communication, Free Press, 60]:
"Mass society not only creates a confusing situation in which
people find it hard to find themselves-it also ... creates  haos, in
which people are confronted by impossible variety-the variety becomes
a slush, which then concentrates merely on the most obvious."
... It seems then, that the metropolis creates weak character in
two almost opposite ways; first, because people are exposed to a
chaos of values; second, because they cling to the superficial uniformity
common to all these values. A nondescript mixture of values
will tend to produce nondescript people.
III.
There are obviously many ways of solving the problem. Some of
these solutions will be private. Others will involve a variety of
social processes including, certainly, education, work, play, and

TOWNS
family. I shall now describe one particular solution, which involves
the large scale social organisation of the metropolis.
The solution is this. The metropolis mwt contain a large number
of di/f erent subcultures, each one strongly articulated, with its own
values sharply delineated, and sharply distinguished from the others.
But though these subcultures must be sharp and distinct and separate,
they must not be closed; they must be readily accessible to one
another, so that a person can move easily from one to another, and
can settle in the one which suits him best.
This solution is based on two assumptions:
 A person will only be able to find his own self, and therefore
to develop a strong character, if he is in a situation where he
receives support for his idiosyncrasies from the people and
values which surround him.
 In order to find his own self, he also needs to live in a milieu
where the possibility of many different value systems is explicitly
recognized and honored. More specifically, he needs a
great variety of choices, so that he is not misled about the nature
of his own person, can see that there are many kinds of
people, and can find those whose values and beliefs correspond
most closely to his own.
one mechanism which might underly people's need for an ambient
culture like their own: Maslow has pointed out that the
process of self actualisation can only start after other needs, like
the need for food and love, and security, have already been satisfied.
[Motivation and Personality, pp. 4-89.] Now the greater the mixture
of kinds of persons in a local urban area, and the more unpredictable
the strangers near your house, the more afraid and insecure
you will become. In Los Angeles and New York this has
reached the stage where people are constantly locking doors and
windows, and where a mother does not feel safe sending her fifteen
year old daughter to the corner mailbox. People are afraid when they
are surrounded by the unfamiliar; the unfamiliar is dangerous. But
so Jong as this fear is an unsolved problem, it will override the rest
of their lives. Self-actualisation will only be able to happen when
this fear is overcome; and that in turn, can only happen, when
people are in familiar territory, among people of their own kind,
whose habits and ways they know, and whom they trust .
. . . However, if we encourage the appearance of distinct subcultures,
in order to satisfy the demands of the first assumption, then we
certainly do not want to encourage these subcultures to be tribal or
closed. That would fly in the face of the very quality which makes
the metropolis so attractive. It must be possible, therefore, for
people to move easily from one subculture to another, and for them
to choose whichever one is most to their taste; and they must be able
 MOSAIC OF SUBCULTURES
to <lo all of this at any moment in their lives. Indeed, if it ever becomes
necessary, the law must guarantee each person freedom of
access to every subculture ....
IV.
It seems clear, then, that the metropolis should contain a large
number of mutually accessible subcultures. But why should those
subcultures be separated in space. Someone with an aspatial bias
could easily argue that these subcultures could, and should, coexist
in the same space, since the essential links which create cultures are
links between people.
I believe this view, if put forward, would be entirely wrong. I
shall now present arguments to show that the articulation of subcultures
is an ecological matter; that distinct subcultures will only survive,
as distinct subcultures, if they are physically separated in space.
First, there is no doubt that people from different subcultures actually
require different things of their environment. Hendricks has
made this point clearly. People of different age groups, different
interests, different emphasis on the family, different national background,
need different kinds of houses, they need different sorts of
outdoor environment round about their houses, and above all, they
need different kinds of community services. These services can only
become highly specialised, in the direction of a particular subculture,
if they are sure of customers. They can only be sure of customers if
customers of the same subculture live in strong concentrations. People
who want to ride horses all need open riding; Germans who want to
be able to buy German food may congregate together, as they do
around German town, New York; old people may need parks to sit
in, less traffic to contend with, nearby nursing services; bachelors may
need quick snack food places; Armenians who want to go to the
orthodox mass every morning will cluster around an Armenian
church; street people collect around their stores and meeting places;
people with many small children will be able to collect around local
nurseries and open play space.
This makes it clear that different subcultures need their own activities,
their own environments. But subcultures not only need to be
concentrated in space to allow for the concentration of the necessary
activities. They also need to be concentrated so that one subculture
does not dilute the next: indeed, from this point of view they not
only need to be internally concentrated-but also physically separated
from one another ....
We cut the quote short here. The rest of the original paper
presents empirical evidence for the need to separate subcultures
spatially, and-in this book-we consider that as part of another
pattern. The argument is given, with empirical details, in SUBCULTURE
BOUNDARY ).

TOWNS
Therefore:
Do everything possible to enrich the cultures and subcultures
of the city, by breaking the city, as far as possible,
into a vast mosaic of small and different subcultures,
each with its own spatial territory, and each with the
power to create its own distinct life style. Make sure
that the subcultures are small enough, so that each person
has access to the full variety of life styles in the subcultures
near his own.

nonresidential land between adjacent subcultures-SUBCULTURE

 SCATTERED WORK**
 I
... this pattern helps the gradual evolution of MOSAIC OF SUBCULTURES
(8), by placing families and work together, and so intensifying
the emergence of highly differentiated subcultures,
each with its individual character.
The artificial separation of houses and work creates intolerable
rifts in people's inner lives.
In modern times almost alJ cities create zones for "work" and
other zones for "living" and in most cases enforce the separation
by law. Two reasons are given for the separation. First, the work-
Concentration and segregation of work ... leads to
dead neighborhoods.

 SCATTERED WORK
places need to be near each other, for commercial reasons. Second,
workplaces destroy the quiet and safety of residential neighborhoods.
But this separation creates enormous rifts in people's emotional
lives. Children grow up in areas where there are no men, except
on weekends; women are trapped in an atmosphere where they
are expected to be pretty, unintelligent housekeepers; men are
forced to accept a schism in which they spend the greater part
of their waking lives "at work, and away from their families" and
then the other part of their lives "with their families, away from
work."
Throughout, this separation reinforces the idea that work is a
toil, while only family life is "living"-a schizophrenic view
which creates tremendous problems for all the members of a
family.
In order to overcome this schism and re-establish the connection
between love and work, central to a sane society, there needs
to be a redistribution of all workplaces throughout the areas where
people live, in such a way that children are near both men and
women during the day, women are able to see themselves both
as loving mothers and wives and still capable of creative work, and
men too are able to experience the hourly connection of their
lives as workmen and their lives as loving husbands and fathers.
What are the requirements for a distribution of work that can
overcome these problemsl
I. Every home is within 0- minutes of many hundreds of
workplaces.
 Many workplaces are within walking distance of children
and families.
 \Vorkers on go home casually for lunch, run errands, work
half-time, and spend half the day at home.
 Some workplaces are in homes; there are many opportunities
for people to work from their homes or to take work home.
 Neighborhoods are protected from the traffic and noise generated
by "noxious" workplaces.
The only pattern of work which does justice to these requirements
is a pattern of scattered work: a pattern in which work is
strongly decentralized. To protect the neighborhoods from the
noise and traffic that workplaces often generate, some noisy work

TOWNS
places can be in the boundaries of neighborhoods, communities
and subcultures-see SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY  I  ; others, not
noisy or noxious, can be built right into homes and neighborhoods.
In both cases, the crucial fact is this: every home is within
a few minutes of dozens of workplaces. Then each household
would have the chance to create for itself an intimate ecology of
home and work: all its members have the option of arranging a
workplace for themselves close to each other and their friends.
People can meet for lunch, children can drop in, workers can
run home. And under the prompting of such connections the
workplaces themselves will inevitably become nicer places, more
like homes, where life is carried on, not banished for eight hours.
This pattern is natura} in traditional societies, where workplaces
are relatively small and households comparatively self-sufficient.
Bur is it compatible with the facts of high technology and the
concentration of workers in factories? How strong is the need for
workplaces to be near each other?
The main argument behind the centralization of plants, and
their gradual increase in size, is an economic one. It has been
demonstrated over and again that there are economies of scale in
production, advantages which accrue from producing a huge number
of goods or services in one place.
However, large centralized organizations are not intrinsic to
mass production. There are many excellent examples which demonstrate
the fact that where work is substantially scattered, people
can still produce goods and services of enormous complexity.
One of the best historical examples is the Jura Federation of
watchmakers, formed in the mountain villages of Switzerland in
the early 7o's. These workers produced watches in their home
workshops, each preserving his independence while coordinating
his efforts with other craftsmen from the surrounding villages.
(For an account of this federation, see, for example, George
Woodcock, Anm·chism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Move
·ments, Cleveland: Meridian Books, 62, pp. -69.)
In our own time, Raymond Vernon has shown that small,
scattered workplaces in the New York metropolitan economy,
respond much faster to changing demands and supplies, and that
the degree of creativity in agglomerations of small businesses is
vastly greater than that of the more cumbersome and centralized

 SCATTERED WORK
industrial giants. See Raymond Vernon, Metropolis  , Chapter
7: External Economics.)
To understand these facts, we must first realize that the city
itself is a vast centralized workspace and that all the benefits of
this centralization are potentially available to every work group
that is a part of the city's vast work community. In effect, the
urban region as a whole acts to produce economies of scale by
bringing thousands of work groups within range of each other.
If this kind of "centralization" is properly developed, it can support
an endless number of combinations between small, scattered
workgroups; and it can lend great flexibility to the modes of production.
"Once we understand that modern industry does not
necessarily bring with it financial and physical concentration, the
growth of smaller centers and a more widespread distribution of
genuine benefits of technology will, I think, take place" Lewis
Mum ford, Sticks and Stones, New York, 24, p. 16).
Remember that even such projects as complicated and seemingly
centralized as the building of a bridge or a moon rocket, can be
organized this way. Contracting and subcontracting procedures
make it possible to produce complicated industrial goods and services
by combining the efforts of hundreds of small firms. The
Apollo project drew together more than 0, independent
firms to produce the complicated spaceships to the moon.
Furthermore, there is evidence that the agencies which set up
such multiple contracts look for small, semi-autonomous firms.
They know instinctively that the smaller, more self-governing
the group, the better the product and the service  Small Sellers
and Large Buyers in American Industry, Business Research Center,

York, 61).
Let us emphasize: we are not suggesting that the decentralization
of work should take precedence over a sophisticated technology.
We believe that the two are compatible: it is possible to
fuse the human requirements for interesting and creative work
with the exquisite technology of modern times. It is possible to
make television sets, xerox machines and IBM typewriters, automobiles,
stereo sets and washing machines under human working
conditions. We mention in particular the xerox and IBM typewriters
because they have played a vital role for us, the authors of

communal way we have done, without these machines: and we
consider them a vital part of the new decentralized society we
seek.

IO MAGIC OF THE CITY

... next to the MOSAIC OF SUBCULTURES ), perhaps the most
important structural feature of a city is the pattern of those
centers where the city life is most intense. These centers can
help to form the mosaic of subcultures by their variety; and they
can also help to form CITY COUNTRY FINGERS  ), if each of
the centers is at a natural meeting point of several fingers. This
pattern was first written by Luis Racionero, under the name
"Downtowns of 00,000."

There are few people who do not enjoy the magic of
a great city. But urban sprawl takes it away from everyone
except the few who are lucky enough, or rich enough, to
live close to the largest centers.
Th is is bound to happen in any urban region with a single
high density core. Land near the core is expensive; few people
can live near enough to it to give them genuine access to the
city's life; most people live far out from the core. To all intents
and purposes, they are in the suburbs and have no more than
occasional access to the city's life. This problem can only be
solved by decentralizing the core to form a multitude of smaller
cores, each devoted to some special way of life, so that, even
though decentralized, each one is still intense and still a center
for the region as a whole.
The mechanism which creates a single isolated core is simple.
Urban services tend to agglomerate. Restaurants, theaters, shops,
carnivals, cafes, hotels, night clubs, entertainment, special services,
tend to cluster. They do so because each one wants to locate in
that position where the most people are. As soon as one nucleus
has formed in a city, each of the interesting services-especially
those which are most interesting and therefore require the largest
catch basin-locate themsclvts in this one nucleus. The one
nucleus keeps growing. The downtown becomes enormous. It
becomes rich, various, fascinating. But gradually, as the metropolitan
area grows, the average distance from an individual house

to this one center increases; and land values around the center
rise so high that houses are driven out from there by shops and
offices-until soon no one, or almost no one, is any longer
genuinely in touch with the magic which is created day and
night within this solitary center.
The problem is clear. On the one hand people will only expend
so much effort to get goods and services ,rnd attend cultural
events, even the very best ones. On the other hand, real variety
and choice can only occur where there is concentrated, centralized
activity; and when the concentration and centralization
become too great, then people are no longer willing to take the
time to go to it.
If we are to resolve the problem by decentralizing centers, we
must ask what the minimum population is that can support a
central business district with the magic of the city. Otis D.
Duncan in "The Optimum Size of Cities" Cities and Society,
P. K. Hatt and A. J. Reiss, eds., New York: The Free Press,
1967, pp. 59-72), shows that cities with more than 0,000
people have a big enough market to sustain  I different kinds of
retail shops and that cities with over I 00, people can support
sophisticated jewelry, fur, and fashion stores. He shows that
cities of 00, can support a university, a museum, a library, a
zoo, a symphony orchestra, a daily newspaper, AM and FM radio,
but that it takes a population of 0, to 00, to support a
specialized professional school like a medical school, an opera, or
all of the TV networks.
In a study of regional shopping centers in metropolitan
Chicago, Brian K. Berry found that centers with  kinds of
retail shops serve a population base of about 0, people
(Geography of Market Centers and Retail Distribution, New
Jersey: Prentice-Hall, I 67, p.  ). T. R. Lakshmanan and
Walter G. Hansen, in "A Retail Potential Model" American
Institute of Planners Journal, May 65, pp. I -43), showed
that full-scale centers with a variety of retail and professional
services, as well as recreational and cultural activities, are feasible
for groups of 00, to 00, population.
It seems quite possible, then, to get very complex and rich
urban functions at the heart of a catch basin which serves no more
than 00, people. Since, for the reasons given earlier, it s

IO MAGIC OF THE CITY
desirable to have as many centers as possible, we propose that the
city region should have one center for each 00, people, with
the centers spaced out widely among the population, so that every
person in the region is reasonably close to at least one of' these
major centers.
To make this more concrete, it is interesting to get some idea
of the range of distances between these centers in a typical urban
region. At a density of  persons per square mile the density
of the less populated parts of Los Angeles the area occupied by
300, will have a diameter of about nine miles; at a higher
density of 0, persons per square mile the density of central
Paris the area occupied by 00, people has a diameter of
about two miles. Other patterns in this language suggest a city
much more dense than Los Angeles, yet somewhat less dense than
central Paris-FOUR-STORY LIMIT 1), DENSITY RINGS ).
We therefore take these crude estimates as upper and lower
bounds. If each center serves 00, people, they will be at least
two miles apart and probably no more than nine miles apart.
One final point must be discussed. The magic of a great city
comes from the enormous specialization of human effort there.
Only a city such as New York can support a restaurant where you
can eat chocolate-covered ants, or buy three-hundred-year-old
books of poems, or find a Caribbean steel band playing with
American folk singers. By comparison, a city of 00, with a
second-rate opera, a couple of large department stores, and half a
dozen good restaurants is a hick town. It would be absurd if the
new downtowns, each serving 00, people, in an effort to
capture the magic of the city, ended up as a multitude of secondclass
hick towns.
This problem can only be solved if each of the cores not only
serves a- catch basin of 00, people but also offers some kind
of special quality which none of the other centers have, so that
each core, though small, serves several million people and can
therefore generate all the excitement and uniqueness which become
possible in such a vast city.
Thus, as it is in Tokyo or London, the pattern must be implemented
in such a way that one core has the best hotels, another
the best antique shops, another the music, still another has the
fish and sailing boats. Then we can be sure that every person is
TOWNS
within reach of at least one downtown and also that all the downtowns
are worth reaching for and really have the magic of a
great metropolis.
Therefore:
Put the magic of the city within reach of everyone in a
metropolitan area. Do this by means of collective regional
policies which restrict the growth of downtown areas so
strongly that no one downtown can grow to serve more
than 00, people. With this population base, the downtowns
will be between two and nine miles apart.

... superimposed over the MOSAIC OF SUBCULTURES ), there
is a need for a still larger cellular structure: the local transport
areas. These areas, - miles across, not only help to form subcultures,
by creating natural boundaries in the city, but they can
also help to generate the individual city fingers in the CITY
COUNTRY FINGERS  ), and they can help to circumscribe each
down town area too, as a special self-contained area of local transportation-
MAGIC OF THE CITY 0).
Cars give people wonderful freedom and increase their
opportunities. But they also destroy the environment, to
an extent so drastic that they kill all social life.
The value and power of the car have proved so great that it
seems impossible to imagine a future without some form of private,
high-speed vehicle. Who will willingly give up the degree of
freedom provided by cars? At the same time, it is undeniably
true that cars turn towns to mincemeat. Somehow local areas must
be saved from the pressure of cars or their future equivalents.
It is possible to solve the problem as soon as we make a distinction
between short trips and long trips. Cars are not very good
for short trips inside a town, and it is on these trips that they do
their greatest damage. But they are good for fairly long trips,
where they cause less damage. The problem will be solved if
towns are divided up into areas about one mile across, with the
idea that cars may be used for trips which leave these areas, but
that other, slower forms of transportation will be used for all
trips inside these areas-foot, bike, horse, taxi. All it needs,
physically, is a street pattern that discourages people from using
private cars for trips within these areas, and encourages the use
of walking, bikes, horses, and taxis instead-but allows the use
of cars for trips which leave the area.
Let us start with a list of the obvious social problems created
by the car:
Air pollution
II LOCAL TRANSPORT AREAS
Noise
Danger
Ill health
Congestion
Parking problem
Eyesore
The first two are very s rious, but are not inherent in the car;
they could both be solved, for instance, by an electric car. They
are, in that sense, temporary problems. Danger will be a persistent
feature of the car so long as we go on using high-speed vehicles
for local trips. The widespread lack of exercise and consequent ill
health created by the use of motor-driven vehicles will persist
unless offset by an amount of daily exercise at least equal to a 0
minute walk per day. And finally, the problems of congestion and
loss of speed, difficulty and cost of parking, and eyesore are all
direct results of the fact that the car is a very large vehicle
which consumes a great deal of space.
The fact that cars are large is, in the end, the most serious
aspect of a transportation system based on the use of cars, since it
is inherent in the oery nature of cars. Let us state this problem in
its most pungent form. A man occupies about  square feet of
space when he is standing still, and perhaps JO square feet when
he is walking. A car occupies about   square feet when it is
:tanding still if we include access), and at  miles an hour,
when cars arc  car lengths apart, it occupies about  square
feet. As we know, most of the time cars have a single occupant.
This means that when people use cars, each person occupies almost
I oo times as much space as he does when he is a pedestrian.
If each person driving occupies an area I oo times as large as he
does when he is on his feet, this means that people are Io times as
far apart. In other words, the use of cars has the ooerall effect of
spreading people out, and keeping them apart.
The effect of this particular feature of cars on the social fabric
is clear. People are drawn away from each other; densities and
corresponding frequencies of interaction decrease substantially.
Contacts become fragmented and specialized, since they are localized
by the nature of the interaction into well-defined indoor
places-the home, the workplace, and maybe he homes of a few
isolated friends.

TOWNS
It is quite possible that the collective cohesion people need to
form a viable society just cannot develop when the vehicles which
people use force them to be Io times farther apart, on the
average, than they have to be. This states the possible social cost
of cars in its strongest form. It may be that cars cause the breakdown
of society, si·mply becaUJe of their geometry.
At the same time that cars cause all these difficulties, they also
have certain unprecedented virtues, which have in fact led to
their enormous success. These virtues are:
Flexibility
Privacy
Door-to-door trips, without transfer
Immediacy
These virtues are particularly important in a metropolitan
region which is essentially two-dimensional. Public transportation
can provide very fast, frequent, door-to-door service, along certain
arteries. But in the widely spread out, two-dimensional character
of a modern urban region, public transportation by itself
cannot compete successfully with cars. Even in cities like London
and Paris, with the finest urban public transportation in the
world, the trains and buses have fewer riders every year because
people are switching to cars. They are willing to put up with
all the delays, congestion, and parking costs, because apparently
the convenience and privacy of the car are more valuable.
Under theoretical analysis of this situation, the only kind of
transportation system which meets all the needs is a system of
individual vehicles, which can use certain high-speed lines for
long cross-city trips and which can use their own power when
they leave the public lines in local areas. The systems which
come closest to this theoretical model are the various Private
Rapid Transit proposals; one example is the Westinghouse Starrcar-
a system in which tiny two-man vehicles drive on streets
locally and onto high-speed public rails for long trips.
However, the Starrcar-type systems have a number of disadvantages.
They make relatively little contribution to the problem
of space. The small cars, though smaller than a conventional car,
still take up vastly more space than a person. Since the private
cars will not be capable of long cross-country trips, they must be

II LOCAL TRANSPORT AREAS
treated as a "second vehicle"-and are rather expensive. They
make no contribution to the health problem, since people are still
sitting motionless while they travel. The system is relatively
antisocial, since people are still encapsulated in "bubbles" while
they travel. It is highly idealistic, since it works if everyone has a
Starrcar, but makes no allowance for the great variety of movement
which people actually desire, i.e., bikes, horses, jalopies,
old classic cars, family buses.
We propose a system which has the advantages of the Starrcar
system but which is more realistic, easier to implement, and, we
believe, better adapted to people's needs. The essence of the
system lies in the following two propositions:
r. For local trips, people use a variety of ]ow-speed, low-co;t
vehicles bicycles, tricycles, scooters, golf carts, bicycle buggies,
horses, etc.), which take up less room than cars and which all
leave their passengers in closer touch with their environment and
with one another.
Many ways of getting around on local trips.
 People still own, and use, cars and trucks-but mainly for
long trips. We assume that these cars can be made to be quiet,
nonpolluting, and simple to repair, and that people simply consider
them best suited for long distance travel. It will still be
possible for people to use a car or a truck for a local trip, either in
a case of emergency, or for some special convenience. However,
the town is constructed in such a way that it is actually expensive
and inconvenient to use cars for local trips-so that people only
do it when they are willing to pay for the very great social costs
of doing so.
TOWNS
Therefore:
Break the urban area down into local transport areas,
each one between I and  miles across, surrounded by a
ring road. Within the local transport area, build minor
local roads and paths for internal movements on foot, by
bike, on horseback, and in local vehicles; build major roads
which make it easy for cars and trucks to get to and from
the ring roads, but place them to make internal local trips
slow and inconvenient.

To keep main roads for long distance traffic, but not for internal

People can only have a genuine effect on local government
when the units of local government are autonomous, self-governing,
self-budgeting communities, which are small enough to create
the possibility of an immediate link between the man in the street
and his local officials and elected representatives.
This is an old idea. It was the model for Athenian democracy
in the third and fourth centuries B.C.; it was Jefferson's plan for
American democracy; it was the tack Confucius took in his book
on government, The Great Digest.
For these people, the practice of exercising power over local
matters was itself an experience of intrinsic satisfaction. Sophocles
wrote that life would be unbearable were it not for the freedom to
initiate action in a small community. And it was considered that
this experience was not only good in itself, but was the only way
of governing that would not lead to corruption. Jefferson wanted
to spread out the power not because "the people" were so bright
and clever, but precisely because they were prone to error, and it
was therefore dangerous to vest power in the hands of a few who
would inevitably make big mistakes. "Break the country into
wards" was his campaign slogan, so that the mistakes will be manageable
and people will get practice and improve.
Today the distance between people and the centers of power
that govern them is vast-both psychologically and geographically.
Milton Kotler, a Jeffersonian, has described the experience:
The process of city administration is invisible to the citizen who
sees little evidence of its human components but feels the sharp pain
of taxation. With increasingly poor public service, his desires and
needs are more insistently expressed. Yet his expressions of need seem

TOWNS
to issue into thin air, for government does not appear attentive to his
demands. This disjunction between citizen and government is the
major political problem of city government, because it embodies
the dynamics of civil disorder .... Milton Kotler, Neighborhood
Foundations, Memorandum # ; "Neighborhood corporations and
the reorganization of city government," unpub. ms., August 67.)
There are two ways in which the physical environment, as it is
now ordered, promotes and sustains the separation between citizens
and their government. First, the size of the political community
is so large that its members are separated from its leaders
simply by their number. Second, government is invisible, physically
located out of the realm of most citizens' daily lives. Unless
these two conditions are altered, political alienation is not likely
to be overcome.
I. The size of the political community. It is obvious that the
larger the community the greater the distance between the
average citizen and the heads of government. Paul Goodman has
proposed a rule of thumb, based on cities like Athens in their
prime, that no citizen be more than two friends away from the
highest member of the local unit. Assume that everyone knows
about   people in his local community. Using this notion and
Goodman's rule we can see that an optimum size for a political
community would be about  or  households or  persons.
This Jigure corresponds to an old Chicago school estimate of
 And it is the same order of magnitude as the size of ECCO,
the neighborhood corporation in Columbus, Ohio, of  to
7000, described by Kotler  Committee on Government Operations,
U.S. Senate, th Congress, Second Session, Part , December
1966).
The editors of The Ecologist have a similar intuition about
the proper size for units of local government. See their Blueprint
for Survival, Penguin Books, 72, pp. 0-55. And
Terence Lee, in his study, "Urban neighborhood as a socio-spatial
schema," Ekistics 7, August 70, gives evidence for the importance
of the spatial community. Lee gives  acres as a natural
size for a community. At  persons per acre, such a community
would accommodate some  persons; at  persons per acre,
some 00.

branches of government are decentralized in function, they are
often still centralized in space, hidden in vast municipal citycounty
buildings out of the realm of everyday life. These places
are intimidating and alienating. What is needed is for every person
to feel at home in the place of his local government with his
ideas and complaints. A person must feel that it is a forum, that
it is his directly, that he can call and talk to the person in charge
of such and such, and see him personally within a day or two.
For this purpose, local forums must be situated in highly visible
and accessible places. They could, for instance, be located in
the most active marketplace of each community of  to 000.

I  SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY*

... the MOSAIC OF SUBCULTURES  and its individual subcultures,
whether they are COMMUNITIES OF   I  or IDENTIFIABLE
NEIGHBORHOODS  I ), need to be completed by boundaries.
In fact, the mere creation of the boundary areas, according
to this pattern, will begin to give life to the subcultures between
the boundaries, by giving them a chance to be themselves.

The mosaic of subcultures requires that hundreds of
different cultures live, in their own way, at full intensity,
next door to one another. But subcultures have their own
ecology. They can only live at full intensity, unhampered
by their neighbors, if they are physically separated by
physical boundaries.
In MOSAIC OF SUBCULTURES  we have argued that a great
variety of subcultures in a city is not a racist pattern which forms
ghettos, but a pattern of opportunity which allows a city to contain
a multitude of different ways of life with the greatest possible
intensity.
But this mosaic will only come into being if the various subcultures
are insulated from one another, at least enough so that no
one of them can oppress, or subdue, the life style of its neighbors,
nor, in return, feel oppressed or subdued. As we shall see, this requires
that adjacent subcultures are separated by swaths of open
land, workplaces, public buildings, water, parks, or other natural
boundaries.
The argument hinges on the following fact. Wherever there is
an area of homogeneous housing in a city, its inhabitants will
exert strong pressure on the areas adjacent to it to make them
conform to their values and style. For example, the "straight"
people who lived near the "hippie" Haight Ashbury district in
San Francisco in  were afraid that the Haight would send
their land values down, so they put pressure on City Hall to get
the Haight "cleaned up"-that is, to make the Haight more like
their own area. This seems to happen whenever one subculture s
I J SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY
very different in style from another one next to it. People will be
afraid that the neighboring area is going to "encroach" on their
own area, upset their land values, undermine their children, send
the "nice" people away, and so forth, and they will do everything
they can to make the next door area like their own.
Carl Werthman, Jerry Mandel, and Ted Dienstfrey Planning
and the Purchase Decision: Why People Buy in Planned Communities,
University of California, Berkeley, July 65 have
noticed the same phenomenon even among very similar subcultures.
In a study of people living in tract developments, they
found that the tension created by adjacencies between dissimilar
social groups disappeared when there was enough open land, unused
land, freeway, or water between them. In short, a physical
barrier between the adjacent subcultures, if big enough, took the
heat off.
Obviously, a rich mix of subcultures will not be possible if each
subculture is being inhibited by pressure from its neighbors. The
subcultures must therefore be separated by land, which is not residential
land, and by as much of it as possible.
There is another kind of empirical observation which supports
this last statement. If we look around a metropolitan area, and pinpoint
the strongly differentiated subcultures, those with character,
we shall always find that they are near boundaries and hardly ever
close to other communities. For example, in San Francisco the
two most distinctive areas are Telegraph Hill and Chinatown.
Telegraph Hill is surrounded on two sides by the docks. Chinatown
is bounded on two sides by the city's banking area. The
same is true in the larger Bay Area. Point Richmond and Sausalito,
Subculture boundaries.

TOWNS
two of the most distinctive communities in the greater Bay Area,
are both almost completely isolated. Sausalito is surrounded by
hills and water; Point .Richmond by water and industrial land.
Communities which are cut off to some extent are free to develop
their own character.
Further support for our argument comes from ecology. In nature,
the differentiation of a species into subspecies is largely due
to the process of geographic speciation, the genetic changes which
take place during a period of spatial isolation see, for example,
Ernst Mayr, Animal Species anrl Evolution, Cambridge, 63,
Chapter I : "The Ecology of Speciation," pp.  - ). It has
been observed in a multitude of ecological studies that members
of the same species develop distinguishable traits when separated
from other members of the species by physical boundaries like a
mountain ridge, a valley, a river, a dry strip of land, a cliff, or a
significant change in climate or vegetatior,. In just the same way,
differentiation between subcultures in a city will be able to take
place most easily when the flow of those elements which account
for cultural variety-values, style, information, and so on-is at
least partially restricted between neighboring subcultures.
Therefore:
Separate neighboring subcultures with a swath of land
at least  feet wide. Let this boundary be natural-wilderness,
farmland, water--or man-made-railroads, major
roads, parks, schools, some housing. Along the seam beI

People need an identifiable spatial unit to belong to.
Today's pattern of development destroys neighborhoods.
They want to be able to identify the part of the city where they
live as distinct from all others. Available evidence suggests, first,
that the neighborhoods which people identify with have extremely
sma. populations; second, that they are small in area; and third,
that a major road through a neighborhood destroys it.
I. What is the right population for a neighborhood?
The neighborhood inhabitants should be able to look after
their own interests by organizing themselves to bring pressure on
city hall or local governments. This means the families in a neighborhood
must be able to reach agreement on basic decisions about
public services, community land, and so forth. Anthropological
evidence suggests that a human group cannot coordinate itself to
reach such decisions if its population is above I 00, and many
people set the figure as low as 00. See, for example, Anthony

How shall we define a major road? The Appleyard-Lintell
study found that with more than  cars per hour, the quality
of the neighborhood begins to deteriorate. On the streets with
  cars per hour people visit their neighbors less and never
gather in the street to meet and talk. Research by Colin Buchanan
indicates that major roads become a barrier to free pedestrian
movement when "most people more than 0% ... have to
adapt their movement to give way to vehicles." This is based on
"an average delay to all crossing pedestrians of  seconds ... as
a very rough guide to the borderline between acceptable and unacceptable
conditions," which happens when the traffic reaches
some  to  cars per hour. Colin D. Buchanan, Traffic in
Towns, London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 63, p. 04.)
Thus any street with greater than  cars per hour, at any time,
will probably seem "major," and start to destroy the neighborhood
identity.
A final note on implementation. Several months ago the City
of Berkeley began a transportation survey with the idea of deciding
the location of all future major arteries within the city. Citizens
were asked to make statements about areas which they wanted
to protect from heavy traffic. This simple request has caused widespread
grass roots political organizing to take place: at the time of
this writing more than  small neighborhoods have identified
themselves, simply in order to make sure that they succeed in keeping
heavy traffic out. In short, the issue of traffic is so fundamental
to the fact of neighborhoods, that neighborhoods emerge, and
crystallize, as soon as people are asked to decide where they want
nearby traffic to be. Perhaps this is a universal way of implementing
this pattern in existing cities.
Therefore:
Help people to define the neighborhoods they live in,
not more than  yards across, with no more than 00
or  inhabitants. In existing cities, encourage local groups
to organize themselves to form such neighborhoods. Give
the neighborhoods some degree of autonomy as far as taxes
and land controls are concerned. Keep major roads outside
these neighborhoods.

idiosyncratic, is guaranteed, for a COMMUNITY OF    ), by
the pattern SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY  ). But a second, smaller
kind of boundary is needed to create the smaller IDENTIFIABLE
NEIGHEORHOOD ).

The strength of the boundary is essential to a neighborhood.
If the boundary is too weak the neighborhood will
not be able to maintain its own identifiable character.
The cell wall of an organic cell is, in most cases, as large as,
or larger, than the cell interior. It is not a surface which divides
inside from outside, but a coherent entity in its own right, which
preserves the functional integrity of the cell and also provides for
a multitude of transactions between the cell interior and the
ambient fluids.
Cell with cell wall: T l,e cell wall
is a place in its own right.
We have already argued, in SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY ),
that a human group, with a specific life style, needs a boundary
around it to protect its idiosyncrasies from encroachment and
dilution by surrounding ways of life. This subculture boundary,
TOWNS
then, functions just like a cell wall-it protects the subculture
and creates space for its transactions with surrounding functions.
The argument applies as strongly to an individual neighborhood,
which is a subculture in microcosm.
However, where the subculture boundaries require wide swaths
of land and commercial and industrial activity, the neighborhood
boundaries can be much more modest. Indeed it is not possible
for a neighborhood of  or more to bound itself with shops
and streets and community facilities; there simply aren't enough
to go around. Of course, the few neighborhood shops there arethe
STREET CAFE 8), the CORNER GROCERY )-will help
to form the edge of the neighborhood, but by and large the
boundary of neighborhoods will have to come from a completely
different morphological principle.
From observations of neighborhoods that succeed in being welldefined,
both physically and in the minds of the townspeople, we
have learned that the single most important feature of a neighborhood's
boundary is restricted access into the neighborhood:
neighborhoods that are successfully defined have definite and relatively
few paths and roads leading into them.
For example, here is a map of the Etna Street neighborhood in
Berkeley.
Na
Ottr neighborhood, compared with
a typ·ical part of a grid system.
There are only seven roads into this neighborhood, compared
with the fourteen which there would be in a typical part of the
street grid. The other roads all dead end in T junctions immediately
at the edge of the neighborhood. Thus, while the Etna
Street neighborhood is not literally walled off from the community,
access into it is subtly restricted. The result is that people
do not come into the neighborhood by car unless they have

I  NEIGHBORHOOD BOUNDARY
business there; and when people are in the neighborhood, they
recognize that they are in a distinct part of town. Of course, the
neighborhood was not "created" deliberately. It was an area of
Berkeley which has become an identifiable neighborhood because
of this accident in the street system.
An extreme example of this principle is the Fuggerei in Augsburg,
illustrated in IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD  ). The
Fuggerei is entirely bounded by the backs of buildings and walls,
and the paths into it are narrow, marked by gateways.
Indeed, if access is restricted, this means, by definition, that
those few points where access is possible, will come to have special
importance. In one way or another, subtly, or more obviously,
they will be gateways, which mark the passage into the neighborhood.
We discuss this more fully in MAIN GATEWAYS 3). But
the fact is that every successful neighborhood is identifiable because
it has some kind of gateways which mark its boundaries: the
boundary comes alive in peoples' minds because they recognize
the gateways.
In case the idea of gateways seems too closed, we remark at
once that the boundary zone-and especially those parts of it
around the gateways-must also form a kind of public meeting
ground, where neighborhoods come together. If each neighborhood
is a self-contained entity, then the community of 000
which the neighborhoods belong to will not control any of the
land internal to the neighborhoods. But it will control all of the
land between the neighborhoods-the boundary land-because
this boundary land is just where functions common to all 000
people must find space. In this sense the boundaries not only
serve to protect individual neighborhoods, but simultaneously
function to unite them in their larger processes.
Therefore:
Encourage the formation of a boundary around each
neighborhood, to separate it from the next door neighborhoods.
Form this boundary by closing down streets and
limiting access to the neighborhood-cut the normal number
of streets at least in half. Place gateways at those points
where the restricted access paths cross the boundary; and
TOWNS
make the boundary zone wide enough to contain meeting
places for the common functions shared by several neighborhoods.
The easiest way of all to form a boundary around a neighborhood
is by turning buildings inward, and by cutting off the
paths which cross the boundary, except for one or two at special
points which become gateways-MAIN GATEWAYS 3); the
public land of the boundary may include a park, collector roads,
small parking lots, and work communities-anything which forms
a natural edge-PARALLEL ROADS( ), WORKC OMMUNITY( 1),
QUIET BACKS(  ), ACCESSIBLEG REEN  0), SHIELDEDP ARKING

I  WEB OF PUBLIC
TRANSPORTATION*
... the city, as defined by CITY COUNTRY FINGERS ), spreads
out in ribbon fashion, throughout the countryside, and is broken
into LOCAL TRANSPORT AREAS II). To connect the transport
areas, and to maintain the flow of people and goods along the
fingers of the cities, it is now necessary to create a web of public
tran portation.

The system of public transportation-the entire web of
airplanes, helicopters, hovercraft, trains, boats, ferries,
buses, taxis, mini-trains, carts, ski-lift , moving sidewalks
-can only work if all the parts are well connected. But
they usually aren't, because the different agencies in charge
of various forms of public transportation have no incentives
to connect to one another.
Here, in brief, is the general public transportation problem. A
city contains a great number of places, distributed rather evenly
across a two-dimensional sheet. The trips people want to make are
typically between two points at random in this sheet. No one
linear system like a train system), can give direct connections
between the vast possible number of point pairs in the city.
It is therefore only possible for systems of public transportation
to work, if there are rich connections between a great variety
of different systems. But these connections are not workable,
unless they are genuine fast, short, connections. The waiting time
for a connection must be short. And the walking distance between
the two connecting systems must be very short.
This much is obvious; and everyone who has thought about
public transportation recognizes its importance. However, obvious
though it is, it is extremely hard to implement.

I  WEB OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
There are two practical difficulties, both of which stem from
the fact that different kinds of public transportation are usually
in the hands of different agencies who are reluctant to cooperate.
They are reluctant to cooperate, partly because they are actually
in competition, and partly just because cooperation makes life
harder for them.
This is particularly true along commuting corridors. Trains,
buses, mini-buses, rapid transit, ferries, and maybe even planes
and helicopters compete for the same passenger market along
these corridors. When each mode is operated by an independent
agency there is no particular incentive to provide feeder services
to the more inflexible modes. Many services are even reluctant
to provide good feeder connections to rapid transit, trains, and
ferries, because their commuter lines are their most lucrative
lines. Similarly, in many cities of the developing world, minibuses
and collectivos provide public transportation along the
main commuting corridors, pulling passengers away from buses.
This leaves the mainlines served by small vehicles, while almost
empty buses reach the peripheral lines, usually because the
public bus company is required to serve these areas, even at a loss.
The solution to the web of public transportation, then, hinges
on the possibility of solving the coordination problem of the
different systems. This is the nut of the matter. We shall now
propose a way of solving it. The traditional way of looking at
public transportation assumes that lines are primary and that th.e
interchanges needed to connect the lines to one another are
secondary. We propose the opposite: namely, that interchanges
are primary and that the transport lines are secondary elements
which connect the interchanges.
Imagine the following organization: each interchange is run
by the community that uses it. The community appoints an interchange
chief for every interchange, and gives him a budget, and
a directive on service. The interchange chief coordinates the
service at his interchange; he charters service from any number of
transport companies-the companies, themselves, are in free
competition with one another to create service.
In this scheme, responsibility for public transportation shifts
from lines to interchanges. The interchanges are responsible for
connecting themselves to each other, and the community which

TOWNS
uses the interchange decides what kinds of service they want to
have passing through it. It is then up to the interchange chief to
persuade these transport modes to pass through it.
Slowly, a service connecting interchanges will build up. One
example which closely follows our model, and shows that this
model is capable of producing a higher level of service than any
centralized agency can produce, is the famous Swiss Railway
System.
The Swiss railway system ... is the densest network in the
world. At great cost and with great trouble, it has been made to serve
the needs of the smallest localities and most remote valleys, not as a
paying proposition but because such was the will of the people. It is
the outcome of fierce political struggles. In the th century, the
"democratic railway movement" brought the small Swiss communities
into conflict with the big towns, which had plans for centralisation .
. . . And if we compare the Swiss system with the French which,
with admirable geometrical regularity, is entirely centered on Paris
so that the prosperities or the decline, the life or death of whole regions
has depended on th:e quality of the link with the capital, we
see the difference between a centralised state and a federal alliance.
The railway map is the easiest to read at a glance, but let us now
superimpose on it another showing economic activity and the movement
of population. The distribution of industrial activity all over
Switzerland, even in the outlying areas, accounts for the strength and
stability of the social structure of the country and prevented those
horrible th century concentrations of industry, with their slums and
rootless proletariat. Colin Ward, "The Organization of Anarchy,"
in Patterns of Anarchy, by Leonard I. Krimerman and Lewis Perry,
New York, 66.)
Therefore:
Treat interchanges as primary and transportation lines
as secondary. Create incentives so that all the different
modes of public transportation-airplanes, helicopters,
ferries, boats, trains, rapid transit, buses, mini-buses, skilifts,
escalators, travelators, elevators-plan their lines to
connect the interchanges, with the hope that gradually
many different lines, of many different types, will meet at
every interchange.
Give the local communities control over their interchanges
so that they can implement the pattern by giving

contracts only to those transportation companies which are
willing to serve these interchanges.

I  RING ROADS
... the ring roads which this pattern specifies, help to define
and generate the LOCAL TRANSPORT AREAS II ; if they are
placed to make connections between INTERCHANGES  ), they
also help to form the WEB OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION( r ).
It is not possible to avoid the need for high speed roads
in modern society; but it is essential to place them and
build them in such a way that they do not destroy communities
or countryside.
Even though the rush of freeways and superhighways built in
the 5o's and r 6o's is slowing down, because of widespread
local protest, we cannot avoid high speed roads altogether. There
is, at present, no prospect for a viable alternative which can provide
for the vast volume of movement of cars and trucks and
buses which a modern city lives on economically and socially.
At the same time, however, high speed roads do enormous
damage when they are badly placed. They slice communities in
half; they cut off waterfronts; they cut off access to the countryside;
and, above all, they create enormous noise. For hundreds
of yards, even a mile or two, the noise of every superhighway
roars in the background.
To resolve these obvious dilemmas that come with the location
and construction of high speed roads, we must find ways of
building and locating these roads, so that they do not destroy
communities and shatter life with their noise. We can give three
requirements that, we believe, go to the heart of this policy:
I. Every community that has coherence as an area of local
transportation-LOCAL TRANSPORT AREAS II )-is never split by
a high speed road, but rather has at least one high speed road
adjacent to it. This allows rapid auto travel from one such community
out to other communities and to the region at large.
 It must be possible for residents of each local transport area
to reach the open countryside without crossing a high speed
road-see CITY COUNTRY FINGERS ). This means, very roughly,

TOWNS
that high speed roads must always be placed in such pos1t1ons
that at least one side of every local transport area has direct access
to open country.
 Most important of all, high speed roads must be shielded
acoustically to protect the life around them. This means that
they must either be sunken, or shielded by earth berms, parking
structures, or warehouses, which will not be damaged by the
noise.
Therefore:
Place high speed roads freeways and other major
arteries so that:
r. At least one high speed road lies tangent to each
local transport area.
 Each local transport area has at least one side not
bounded by a high speed road, but directly open to
the countryside.
 The road is always sunken, or shielded along its
length by berms, or earth, or industrial buildings, to
protect the nearby neighborhoods from noise.

I  NETWORK OF LEARNING*

... another network, not physical like transportation, but conceptual,
and equal in importance, is the network of learning: the
thousands of interconnected situations that occur all over the city,
and which in fact comprise the city's "curriculum": the way of
life it teaches to its young.
In a society which emphasizes teaching, children and
students-and adults-become passive and unable to think
or act for themselves. Creative, active individuals can only
grow up in a society which emphasizes learning instead of
teaching.
There is no need to add to the criticism of our public schools. The
critique is extensive and can hardly be improved on. The processes
of learning and teaching, too, have been exhaustively studied ....
The question now is what to do. George Dennison, Lives of Children,
New York: Vintage Books, 69, p. .)
To date, the most penetrating analysis and proposal for an
alternative framework for education comes from I van Illich in
his book, De-Schooling Society, and his article, "Education without
Schools: How It Can Be Done," in the New York Review of
Books, New York,  ): -31, special supplement, July
I  I.
Illich describes a style of learning that is quite the opposite
from schools. It is geared especially to the rich opportunities for
learning that are natural to every metropolitan area:
The alternative to social control through the schools is the voluntary
participation in society through networks which provide access to
all its resources for learning. In fact these networks now exist, but
they are rarely used for educational purposes. The crisis of schooling,
if it is to have any positive consequence, will inevitably lead to their
incorporation into the educational process ....
Schools are designed on the assumption that there is a secret to
everything in life; that the quality of life depends on knowing that
secret; that secrets can be known only in orderly successions; and
that only teachers can properly reveal these secrets. An individual
with a schooled mind conceives of the world as a pyramid of classified
packages accessible only to those who carry the proper tags.

I  NETWORK OF LEARNING
New educational institutions would break apart t!tis pyramid. Their
purpose must be to facilitate access for t!te learner: to allow him to
look into the windows of t!te control room or the parliament, if he
cannot get in the door. Moreover, such new institutions should be
channels to which the learner would have access without credentials
or pedigree-public spaces in which peers and elders outside his immediate
horizon now become available ....
While network administrators would concentrate primarily on the
building and maintenance of roads providing access to resources, the
pedagogue would help the student to find the path which for him
could lead fastest to his goal. If a student wants to learn spoken
Cantonese from a Chinese neighbor, the pedagogue would be available
to judge their proficiency, and io help them select the textbook
and methods most suitable to their talents, character, and the time
available for study. He can counsel the would-be airplane mechanic
on finding the best places for apprenticeship. He can recommend
books to somebody who wants to find challenging peers to discuss
African history. Like the network administrator, the pedagogical
counselor conceives of himself as a professional educator. Access to
either could be gained by individuals through the use of educational
vouchers ....
In addition to the tentative conclusions of the Carnegie Commission
reports, the last year has brought forth a series of important
documents which show that responsible people are becoming aware
of the fact that schooling for certification cannot continue to be
counted upon as the central educational device of a modern society.
Julius Nyere of Tanzania has announced plans to integrate education
with the life of the village. In Canada, the Wright Commission on
post-secondary education has reported that no known system of
formal education could provide equal opportunities for the citizens of
Ontario. The president of Peru has accepted the recommendation of
his commission on education, which proposes to abolish free schools
in favor of free educational opportunities provided throughout life.
In fact he is reported to have insisted that this program proceed
slowly at first in order to keep teachers in school and out of the way
of true educators. Abridged from pp.  and  in Desc!tooling
Society by Ivan Illich. Vol.  in World Perspectives Series, edited
by Ruth Nanda Anshen, New York: Harper & Row, 71.)
In short, the educational system so radically decentralized
becomes congruent with the urban structure itself. People of all
walks of life come forth, and offer a class in the things they
know and love: professionals and workgroups offer apprenticeships
in their offices and workshops, old people offer to teach
whatever their life work and interest has been, specialists offer
tutoring in their special subjects. Living and learning are the
I 01
TOWNS
same. It is not hard to imagine that eventually every third or
fourth household will have at least one person in it who is offering
a class or training of some kind.
Therefore:
Instead of the lock-step of compulsory schooling in a
fixed place, work in piecemeal ways to decentralize the
process of learning and enrich it through contact with
many places and people all over the city: workshops,
teachers at home or walking through the city, professionals
willing to take on the young as helpers, older children
teaching younger children, museums, youth groups traveling,
scholarly seminars, industrial workshops, old people,
and so on. Conceive of all these situations as forming the
backbone of the learning process; survey all these situations,
describe them, and publish them as the city's "curriculum";
then let students, children, their families and
neighborhoods weave together for themselves the situations
that comprise their "school" paying as they go with standard
vouchers, raised by community tax. Build new educational
facilities in a way which extends and enriches
this network.

locate shops and services where they are needed, in such a way
that they will strengthen the MOSAJc OF SUBCULTURES ),
SUBCULTURE BOUNDARIES  I ), and the decentralized economy
needed for SCATTERED WORK   and LOCAL TRANSPORT AREAS

Shops rarely place themselves in those positions which
best serve the people's needs, and also guarantee their own
stability.
Large parts of towns have insufficient services. New shops
which could provide these services often locate near the other
shops and major centers, instead of locating themselves where
they are needed. In an ideal town, where the shops are seen as
part of the society's necessities and not merely as a way of making
profit for the shopping chains, the shops would be much more
widely and more homogeneously distributed than they are today.
It is also true that many small shops are unstable. Two-thirds
of the small shops that people open go out of business within a
year. Obviously, the community is not well served by unstable
businesses, and once again, their economic instability is largely
linked to mistakes of location.
To guarantee that shops are stable, as well as distributed to
meet community needs, each new shop must be placed where it
will fill a gap among the other shops offering a roughly similar
service and also be assured that it will get the threshold of customers
which it needs in order to survive. We shall now try to
express this principle in precise terms.
The characteristics of a stable system of shops is rather well
known. It relies, essentially, on the idea that each unit of shopping
has a certain catch basin-the population which it needs in order

I WEB OF SHOPPING
to survive-and that units of any given type and size will therefore
be stable if they are evenly distributed, each one at the
center of a catch basin large enough to support it.

Catch basins.
The reason that shops and shopping centers do not always,
automatically, distribute themselves according to their appropriate
catch basins is easily explained by the situation known as Hotelling's
problem. Imagine a beach in summer time-and, somewhere
along the beach, an ice-cream seller. Suppose now, that
you are also an ice-cream seller. You arrive on the beach. Where
should you place yourself in relation to the first ice-cream seller?
There are two possible solutions .
• •
••
Two approaches to the ice-cream problem.
In the first case, you essentially decide to split the beach with
the other ice-cream seller. You take half the beach, and leave him
half the beach. In this case, you place yourself as far away from
him as you can, in a position where half the people on the beach
are nearer to you than to him.
In the second case, you place yourself right next to him. You
decide, in short, to try and compete with him-and place yourself
in such a way as to command the whole beach, not half of it.

TOWNS
Every time a shop, or shopping center opens, it faces a
similar choice. It can either locate in a new area where there
are no other competing businesses, or it can place itself exactly
where all the other businesses are already in the hope of attracting
their customers away from them.
The trouble is, very simply, that people tend to choose the
second of these two alternatives, because it seems, on the surface,
to be safer. In fact, however, the first of the two choices is
both better and safer. It is better for the customers, who then
have stores to serve them closer to their homes and work places
than they do now; and it is safer for the shopkeepers themselves
since-in spite of appearances-their stores are much more likely
to survive when they stand, without competition, in the middle of
a catch basin which needs their services.
Let us now consider the global nature of a web which has this
character. In present cities, shops of similar types tend to be
clustered in shopping centers. They are forced to cluster, in
part because of zoning ordinances, which forbid them to locate in
so-called residential areas; and they are encouraged to cluster by
their mistaken notion that competition with other shops will
serve them better than roughly equal sharing of the available
customers. In the "peoples" web we are proposing, shops are far
more evenly spread out, with less emphasis on competition and
greater emphasis on service. Of course, there will still be competition,
enough to make sure that very bad shops go out of business,
because each shop will be capable of drawing customers from
the nearby catch basins if it offers better service-but the accent
is on cooperation instead of competition.

The existing web. T/ze peoples' web.

I WEB OF SHOPPING
To generate this kind of homogeneous people's web, it is only
necessary that each new shop follow the following three-step procedure
when it chooses a location:
r. Identify all other shops which offer the service you are
interested in; locate them on the map.
 Identify and map the location of potential consumers.
Wherever possible, indicate the density or total number of
potential consumers in any given area.
 Look for the biggest gap in the existing web of shops m
those areas where there are potential consumers.
The gap in services.
Two colleagues of ours have tested the efficiency and potential
stability of the webs created by this procedure. "Computer
Simulation of Market Location in an Urban Area," S. Angel and
F. Loetterle, CES files, June 67. They chose to study
markets. They began with a fixed area, a known population
density and purchasing power, and a random distribution of
markets of different sizes. They then created new markets and
killed off old markets according to the following rules. I)
Among all of the existing markets, erase any that do not capture
sufficient business to support their given size;   among all of
the possible locations for a new market, find the one which
would most strongly support a new market;   find that size
for the new market that would be most economically feasible;  )
find that market among all those now existing that is the least
economically feasible, and erase it from the web;   repeat
steps  through  until no further improvement in the web
can be made.
Under the impact of these rules, the random distribution of

TOWNS
markets at the beginning leads gradually to a fluctuating, pulsating
distribution of markets which remains economically stable throughout
its changes.
Now of course, even if shops of the same kind are kept apart
by this procedure, shops of different kinds will tend to cluster.
This follows, simply, from the convenience of the shopper. If we
follow the rules of location given above-always locating a new
shop in the biggest gap in the web of similar shops-then, within
that gap there are still quite a large number of different possible
places to locate: and naturally, we shall try to locate near the
largest cluster of other shops within that gap, to increase the
number of people coming past the shop, in short, to make it
more convenient for shoppers.
The clusters which emerge have been thoroughly studied by
Berry. It turns out that the levels of clustering are remarkably
similar, even though their spacing varies greatly according to
population density. See Geography of Market Centers and
Retail Distribution, B. Berry, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey:
Prentice-Hall, Inc., 67, pp. 2-33. The elements m this
web of clustering correspond closely to patterns defined in this
language.
Therefore:
When you locate any individual shop, follow a threestep
procedure:
I. Identify all other shops which offer the service you
are interested in; locate them on the map.
 Identify and map the location of potential consumers.
Wherever possible, indicate the density or total number
of potential consumers in any given area.
 Look for the biggest gap in the existing web of shops
in those areas where there are potential consumers.
 Within the gap in the web of similar shops, locate your
shop next to the largest cluster of other kinds of shops.

... this pattern helps complete the LOCAL TRANSPORT AREAS
(II and the WEB OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION  I ). The local
transport areas rely heavily on foot traffic, and on bikes and carts
and horses. The web of public transportation relies on trains and
planes and buses. Both of these patterns need a more flexible kind
of public transportation to support them.
Public transportation must be able to take people from
any point to any other point within the metropolitan area.
Buses and trains, which run along lines, are too far from most
origins and destinations to be useful. Taxis, which can go from
point to point, are too expensive.
To solve the problem, it is necessary to have a kind of vehicle
which is half way between the two-half like a bus, half like a
taxi-a small bus which can pick up people at any point and take
them to any other point, but which may also pick up other passengers
on the way, to make the trip less costly than a taxi fare.
Recent research, and full-scale experiments, have shown that a
system of mini-buses, on call by telephone, can function in this
fashion, taking people from door to door in I  minutes, for no
more than  cents a ride  74): and that the system is efficient
enough to support itself. It works just like a taxi, except that it
picks up and drops off other passengers while you are riding; it
goes to the nearest corner to save time--not to your own front
door; and it costs a quarter of an average taxi fare.
The system hinges, to a certain cxte'nt, on the development of
sophisticated new computer programs. As calls come in, the computer
examines the present movements of all the various minibuses,
each with its particular load of passengers, and decides
which bus can best afford to pick up the new passenger, with the
least detour. Two-way radio contact keeps the mini-buses in communication
with the dispatcher at the computer switchboard. All
th is, and other details, are discussed fully in a review of current

dial-a-bus research: Summary Report-The Dial-a-Ride Transportation
System, M.I.T. Urban Systems Laboratory, Report
# USL-TR-70-10, March I9ir.
Dial systems for buses are actually coming in to existence now
because they are economically feasible. While conventional fixedroute
public transport systems are experiencing a dangerous spiral
of lower levels of service, fewer passengers, and increased public
subsidies, over  working dial-a-bus systems are presently in successful
operation throughout the world. For example, a dial-a-bus
system in Regina, Saskatchewan, is the only part of the Regina
Transit System which supports itself Regina Telebus Study:
Operations Report, and Financial Report, \V. G. Atkinson et al.,
June 72). In Batavia, New York, dial-a-bus is the sole means
of public transport, serving a population of I , at fares of 0
to  cents per ride.
We finish this pattern by reminding the reader of two vital
problems of public transportation, which underline the importance
of the mini-bus approach.
First, there are very large numbers of people in cities who
cannot drive; we believe the mini-bus system is the only realistic
way of meeting the needs of all these people.
Their numbers are much larger than one would think. They are,
in effect, a silent minority comprising the uncomplaining old and
physically handicapped, the young and the poor. In  70, over 0
percent of U.S. households did not own a car. Fifty-seven and fivetenths
percent of all households with incomes under $  did not
own a car. For households headed by persons  years of age or
older, 4. percent did not own a car. Of the youths between Io and
 years of age,  percent are dependent on others, including public
I I I
TOWNS
transit, for their mobility. Among the physically disabled about  .7
million are potential riders of public transportation if the system
could take them door-to-door. Sumner Myers, "Turning Transit
Subsidies into 'Compensatory Transportation,'" City, Vol. , No. ,
Summer 72, p. 0.)
Second, quite apart from these special needs, the fact is that a
web of public transportation, with large buses, boats, and trains,
will not work anyway, without a mini-bus system. The large systems
need feeders: some way of getting to the stations. If people
have to get in their cars to go to the train, then, once in the car,
they stay in it and do not use the train at all. The mini-bus system
is essential for the purpose of providing feeder service in the larger
web of public transportation.
Therefore:
Establish a system of small taxi-like buses, carrying up
to six people each, radio-controlled, on call by telephone,
able to provide point-to-point service according to the passengers'
needs, and supplemented by a computer system
which guarantees minimum detours, and minimum waiting
times. Make bus stops for the mini-buses every 00
feet in each direction, and equip these bus stops with a
phone for dialing a bus.

... within an urban area, the density of building fluctuates. It
will, in general, be rather higher toward the center and lower
toward the edges crry COUNTRY FINGERS ), LACE OF COUNTRY
STREETS s), MAGIC OF THE CITY 0). However, throughout
the city, even at its densest points, there are strong human
reasons to subject all buildings to height restrictions.

There is abundant evidence to show that high buildings
make people crazy.
High buildings have no genuine advantages, except in speculative
gains for banks and land owners. They are not cheaper,
they do not help create open space, they destroy the townscape,
they destroy social life, they promote crime, they make life difficult
for children, they are expensive to maintain, they wreck the
open spaces near them, and they damage light and air and view.
But quite apart from all of this, which shows that they aren't very
sensible, empirical evidence shows that they can actually damage
people's minds and feelings.

TOWNS
There are two separate bodies of evidence for this. One shows
the effect of high-rise housing on the mental and social well being
of families. The other shows the effect of large buildings, and
high buildings, on the human relations in offices and workplaces.
We present the ti rst of these two bodies of evidence in the text
which follows. The second, concerning offices and workplaces, we
have placed in BUILDING COMPLEX 5), since it has implications
not just for the height of buildings but also for their total volume.
We wish to stress, however, that the seemingly one-sided concern
with housing in the paragraphs which follow, is only apparent.
The underlying phenomenon-namely, mental disorder
and social alienation created by the height of buildings-occurs
equally in housing and in workplaces.
The strongest evidence comes from D. M. Fanning "Families
in Flats," British Medical Journal, November , 67, pp. 2-
86). Fanning shows a direct correlation between incidence of
mental disorder and the height of people's apartments. The
higher people live off the ground, the more likely are they to
suffer mental illness. And it is not simply a case of people prone
to mental illness choosing high-rise apartments. F,rnning shows
that the correlation is strongest for the people who spend the
most time in their apartments. Among the families he studied, the
correlation was strongest for women, who spend the most time in
their apartments; it was less strong for children, who spend less
time in the apartments; and it was weakest for men, who spend
the least amount of time in their apartments. This strongly suggests
that sheer time spent in the high-rise is itself what causes the
elf ect.
A simple mechanism may explain this: high-rise living takes
people away from the ground, and away from the casual, everyday
society that occurs on the sidewalks and streets and on the
gardens and porches. It leaves them alone in their apartments.
The decision to go out for some public life becomes formal and
awkward; and unless there is some specific task which brings people
out in the world, the tendency is to stay home, alone. The
forced isolation then causes individual breakdowns.
Fanning's findings are reinforced by Dr. D. Cappon's clinical
experiences reported in "Mental Health and the High Rise,"
Canadian Public Health Association, April I  I:
II6
 I FOUR-STORY LIMIT
There is every reason to believe that high-rise apartment dwelling
has adverse effects on mental and social health. And there is sufficient
clinical, anecdotal and intuitive observations to back this up. Herewith,
in no particular order ranking, a host of factors:
In my experience as Mental Health Director in a child guidance
clinic in York Township, Toronto, for  years, I saw numerous children
who had been kinetically deprived ... and kinetic deprivation
is the worst of the perceptual, exploratory kinds, for a young child,
leaving legacies of lethargy, or restlessness, antisocial acting out or
withdrawal, depersonalization or psychopathy.
Young children in a high-rise are much more socially deprived
of neighborhood peers and activities than their S.F.D. Single Family
Dwelling counterparts, hence they are poorly socialized and at too
close quarters to adults, who are tense and irritable as a consequence.
Adolescents in a high-rise suffer more from the "nothing-to-do"
ennui than those of a S.F.D., with enhanced social needs for "drop
in centres" and a greater tendency to escapism ....
Mothers are more anxious about their very young ones, when they
can't see them in the street below, from a convenient kitchen window.
There is higher passivity in the high-rise because of the barriers to
active outlets on the ground; such barriers as elevators, corridors;
and generally there is a time lapse and an effort in negotiating the
vertical journey. TV watching is extended in the high-rise. This affects
probably most adversely the old who need kinesia and activity,
in proportion, as much as the very young do. Though immobility
saves them from accidents, it also shortens their life in a high-rise ....
A Danish study by Jeanne Morville adds more evidence Borns

Children from the high blocks start playing out of doors on their
own at a later age than children from the low blocks: Only  % of
the children aged two to three years in the high point blocks play
on their own out of doors, while  % of the children in the low
blocks do this.
Among the children aged five years in the high point blocks %
do not as yet play on their own out of doors, while in the low blocks
all the children aged five do so .... The percentage of young children
playing out of doors on their own decreases with the height of
their homes; 0% of all the children from the three lower floors in
the high point blocks play on their own out of doors, while only
  % of the children from the three upper floors do so. . ..
Young children in the high blocks have fewer contacts with playmates
than those in the low blocks: Among children aged one, two
and three years, 6% from the low blocks have daily contact with
playmates; this applies to only  % from the high blocks.

More recently, there is the evidence brought forward by Oscar
Newman in Defensible Space. Newman compared two adjacent
housing projects in New York-one high-rise, the other a
collection of relatively small three-story walk-up buildings. The
two projects have the same overall density, and their inhabitants
have roughly the same income. But Newman found that the
crime rate in the !tigh-rise was roug!tly twice that in the walk-ups.
At what height do the effects described by Fanning, Cappon,
MorvilJe, and Newman begin to take hold/ It is our experience
that in both housing and office buildings, the problems begin
when buildings are more than four stories high.
At three or four stories, one can still walk comfortably down to
the street, and from a window you can still feel part of the street
scene: you can see details in the street-the people, their faces,
foliage, shops. From three stories you can yell out, and catch the
attention of someone below. Above four stories these connections
break down. The visual detail is lost; people speak of the scene
below as if it were a game, from which they are completely detached.
The connection to the ground and to the fabric of the
town becomes tenuous; the building becomes a world of its own:
with its own elevators and cafeterias.
We believe, therefore, that the "four-story limit" is an appropriate
way to express the proper connection between building
height and the health of a people. Of course, it is the spirit of the
pattern which is most essential. Certainly, a building five stories
high, perhaps even six, might work if it were carefully handled.
But it is difficult. On the whole, we advocate a four-story limit,
with only occasional departures, throughout the town.
Finally, we give the children of Glasgow the last word.
To fling a "piece," a slice of bread and jam, from a window down
to a child in the street below has been a recognised custom in Glasgow's
tenement housing ....

Therefore:
In any urban area, no matter how dense, keep the majority
of buildings four stories high or less. It is possible that
certain buildings should exceed this limit, but they should
never be buildings for human habitation.

Within the framework of the four-story limit the exact height
of individual buildings, according to the area of floor they need,
the area of the site, and the height of surrounding buildings, is
given by the pattern NUMBER OF STORIES  6). More global
variations of density are given by DENSITY RINGS  ). The horizontal
subdivision of large buildings into smaller units, and
separate smaller buildings, is given by BUILDING COMPLEX 5).

four-story limit. And finally, don't take the four-story limit too
literally. Occasional exceptions from the general rule are very important-
HIGH PLACES  2 ....

 NINE PER CENT
PARKING**

... the integrity of local transport areas and the tranquility of
local communities and neighborhoods depend very much on the
amount of parking they provide. The more parking they provide,
the less possible it will be to maintain these patterns, because the
parking spaces will attract cars, which in turn violate the local
transport areas and neighborhoods-LOCAL TRANSPORT AREAS
(II), COMMUNITY OF   I ), IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD
( I ). This pattern proposes radical limits on the distribution of
parking spaces, to protect communities.

Very simply-when the area devoted to parking s too
great, it destroys the land.
In downtown Los Angeles over  per cent
of the land is given over to the automobile.
Very rough empirical observations lead us to believe that it is
not possible to make an environment fit for human use when
more than  per cent of it is given to parking.
Our observations are very tentative. We have yet to perform
systematic studies---our observations rely on our own subjective
estimates of cases where "there are too many cars" and cases where
"the cars are all right." However, we have found in our preliminary
observations, that different people agree to a remarkable extent
about these estimates. This suggests that we are dealing with
a phenomenon which, though obscure, is nonetheless substantial.
An example of an environment which has the threshold density
of  per cent parking, is shown in our key photograph: a quadrant
I  I
TOWNS
of the University of Oregon. Many people we have talked to
feel intuitively that this area is beautiful now, but that if more
cars were parked there it would be ruined.
What possible functional basis is there for this intuition? We
conjecture as follows: people realize, subconsciously, that the
physical environment is the medium for their social intercourse.
lt is the environment which, when it is working properly, creates
the potential for all social communion, including even communion
with the self.
We suspect that when the density of cars passes a certain limit,
and people experience the feeling that there are too many cars,
what is really happening is that subconsciously they feel that the
cars are overwhelming the environment, that the environment is
no longer "theirs," that they have no right to be there, that it is
not a place for people, and so on. After all, the effect of the cars
reaches far beyond the mere presence of the cars themselves. They
create a maze of driveways, garage doors, asphalt and concrete
surfaces, and building elements which people cannot use. When
the density goes beyond the limit, we suspect that people feel the
social potential of the environment has disappeared. Instead of
inviting them out, the environment starts giving them the message
that the outdoors is not meant for them, that they should
stay indoors, that they should stay in their own buildings, that
social communion is no longer permitted or encouraged.
We have not yet tested this suspicion. However, if it turns
out to be true, it may be that this pattern, which seems to be
based on such slender evidence, is in fact one of the most crucial
patterns there is, and that it plays a key role in determining the
difference between environments which are socially and psychologically
healthy and those which are unhealthy.
We conjecture, then, that environments which are human,
and not destroyed socially or ecologically by the presence of
parked cars, have less than  per cent of the ground area devoted
to parking space; and that parking lots and garages must therefore
never be allowed to cover more than  per cent of the land.
It is essential to interpret this pattern in the strictest possible
way. The pattern becomes meaningless if we allow ourselves to
place the parking generated by a piece of land A, on another adjacent
piece of land B, thus keeping parking on A below  per

 NINE PER CENT PARKING
cent, but ra1slllg the parking on B to more than  per cent. In
other words, each piece of land must take care of itself; we must
not allow ourselves to solve this problem on one piece of land at
the expense of some other piece of land. A town or a community
can only implement the pattern according to this strict interpretation
by defining a grid of independent "parking zones"-each
zone I to IO acres in area-which cover the whole community,
and then insisting that the rule be applied, independently, and
strictly, inside every parking zone.
The  per cent rule has a clear and immediate implication for
the balance between surface parking and parking in garages, at
different parking densities. This follows from simple arithmetic.
Suppose, for example, that an area requires  parking spaces per
acre. Twenty parking spaces will consume about  square feet,
which would be  per cent of the land if it were all in surface
parking. To keep  cars per acre in line with the  per cent
rule, at least half of them will have to be parked in garages. The
table below gives similar figures for different densities:
Cars per Per cent on Per cent in two Per cent in three
acre surface story garages story garages
I  00
  0

What about underground parking? May we consider it as an
exception to this rule  Only if it does not violate or restrict the
use of the land above.  f, for example, a parking garage is under a
piece of land which was previously used as open space, with great
trees growing on it, then the garage will almost certainly change
the nature of the space above, because it will no longer be possible
to grow large trees there. Such a parking garage is a violation
of the land. SimiLuly, if the structural grid of the garage-
 foot bays-constrains the strnctural grid of the building above,
so that this building is not free to express its needs, this is a violation
too. Underground parking may be allowed only in those
rare cases where it does not constrain the land above at all: under
a major road, perhaps, or under a tennis court.
We see then, that the  per cent rule has colossal implications.

TOWNS
Since underground parking will only rarely satisfy the conditions
we have stated, the pattern really says that almost no part of the
urban area may have more than  parking spaces per acre. This
will create large changes in the central business district. Consider
a part of a typical downtown area. There may be several hundred
commuters per acre working there; and, under today's conditions,
many of them park their cars in garages. But if it is true that
there cannot be more than  parking spaces per acre, then either
the work will be forced to decentralize, or the workers will have
to rely on public transportation. It seems, in short, that this simple
pattern, based on the social psychology of the environment, leads
us to the same far reaching social conclusions as the patterns WEB
OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION   and SCATTERED WORK  ).
Therefore:
Do not allow more than  per cent of the land in any
given area to be used for parking. In order to prevent the
"bunching" of parking in huge neglected areas, it is necessary
for a town or a community to subdivide its land into
"parking zones" no larger than  acres each and to apply
the same rule in each zone.

Two later patterns say that parking must take one of two forms:
tiny, surface parking lots, or shielded parking structures-

 NINE PER CENT PARKING
SHIELDED PARKING 7), SMALL PARKING LOTS 03). If you
accept these patterns the  per cent rule will put an effective upper
limit of  parking spaces per acre, on every part of the environment.
Present-day on-street parking, with driveways, which
provides spaces for about   cars per acre on the ground is ruled
out. And those present-day high density business developments
which depend on the car are also ruled out. . . .

 PARALLEL ROADS
in earlier patterns, we have proposed that c1t1es should be
subdivided into local transport areas, whose roads allow cars to
move in and out from the ring roads, but strongly discourage internal
movement across the area-LOCAL TRANSPORT AREAS  1),
RING ROADS  I )-and that these transport areas themselves be
further subdivided into communities and neighborhoods, with
the provision that all major roads are in the boundaries between
communities and neighborhoods-SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY  r ),
NEIGHBORHOOD BOUNDARY  I ). Now, what should the arrangement
of these roads be like, to help the flow required by LOCAL
TRANSPORT AREAS II), and to maintain the boundaries?
The net-like pattern of streets is obsolete. Congestion is
choking cities. Cars can average  miles per hour on freeways,
but trips across town have an average speed of only
IO to  miles per hour.
Certainly, in many cases, we want to get rid of cars, not help
them to go faster. This is fully discussed in LOCAL TRANSPORT
AREAS II). But away from the areas where children play and
people walk or use their bikes, there still need to be certain
streets which carry cars. The question is: How can these streets
be designed to carry the cars faster and without congestion?
It turns out that the loss of speed on present city streets is
caused mainly by crossing movements: left-hand turns across
traffic and four-way intersections. G. F. Newell, "The Effect of
Left Turns on the Capacity of Traffic Intersection," Quarterly of
Applied Mathematics, XVII, April 59, pp. -76.)
To speed up traffic it is therefore necessary to create a network
of major roads in which there are no four-way intersections, and
no left-hand turns across traffic. This can easily be done if the
major roads are alternating, one-way parallel roads, a few hundred
feet apart, with smaller local roads opening off them, and the only
connections between the parallel roads given by larger freeways
crossing them at two- or three-mile intervals.

Parallel roads.
This pattern has been discussed at considerable length in three
papers "The Pattern of Streets," C. Alexander, A IF Journal,
September 66; Criticisms by D. Carson and P. Roosen-Runge,
and Alexander's reply, in AIP lottrnal, September 67. We
refer the reader to these original papers for the full derivation of
all the geometric details. Our present statement is a radically condensed
version. Here we concentrate mainly on one puzzling
question-that of detours-because this is for many people the
most surprising aspect of the full analysis.
The pattern of parallel roads--since it contains no major cross
streets--creates many detours not present in today's net-Ii ke pattern.
At first sight it seems likely that these detours will be impossibly
large. However, in the papers mentioned above it is
shown in detail that they are in fact perfectly reasonable. We
summarize the argument below.
It is possible to calculate the probable detour for any trip of a
given length through this proposed parallel road system as a function
of the distance between the cross roads. Next, the probability
of any given trip length may be obtained from actual studies of
metropolitan auto trips. These two types of probabilities can
finally be combined to yield an overall mean trip length and overall
mean detours as shown below.

* Data for distribution of trip lengths was obtained from Edward
M. Hall, "Travel Characteristics of Two San Diego Suburban
Developments," Highway Research Board Bulletin 039, Washington,
D. C., 58, pp. -19, Figure  r. These data are typical for
metropolitan areas all over the Western world.

2J PARALLEL ROADS
We see, therefore, that even with cross roads two miles apart,
the lack of cross streets only increases trip lengths by  per cent.
At the same time, the average speed of trips will increase from
I  miles per hour to about   miles per hour, a three/ old increase.
The huge savings in time and fuel costs will more than
offset the slight increase in distance.
Referring back for a moment to the table of detours, it will be
noticed that the highest detours occur for the shortest trips. We
have argued elsewhere-LOCAL TRANSPORT AREAS II )-that to
preserve the quality of the city's environment it is necessary to
discourage the use of the automobile for very short trips, and to
encourage walking, bikes, buses, and horses instead. The pattern of
parallel roads has precisely the feature which local transport areas
need. It makes longer trips vastly more efficient, while discouraging
the very short auto trips, and so provides the local transport
area with just the internal structure which it needs to support its
function.
Although this pattern seems strange at first sight, it is in fact
already happening in many parts of the world and has already
proved its worth. For example, Berne, Switzerland, is one of the
few cities in Europe that does not suffer from acute traffic congestion.
When one looks at a map of Berne, one can see that its
old center is formed by five long parallel roads with almost no
cross streets. We believe that it has little congestion in the old
center precisely because it contains the pattern. In many large
cities today, the same insight is being implemented piecemeal-in
the form of more and more one-way streets: in New York the
alternating one-way Avenues, in downtown San Francisco the
one-way major streets.

Therefore:
Within a local transport area build no intersecting major
roads at all; instead, build a system of parallel and alternating
one-way roads to carry traffic to the RING ROADS
(17). In existing towns, create this structure piecemeal, by
gradually making major streets one-way and closing cross
streets. Keep parallel roads at least  yards apart to
make room for neighborhoods between them and no more
than  or  yards apart.

the parallel roads a "T"-T JUNCTION  0). Keep the pedestrian

 SACRED SITES*
I  I
in every region and every town, indeed in every neighborhood,
there are special places which have come to symbolize the
area, and the people's roots there. These places may be natural
beauties or historic landmarks left by ages past. But in some form
they are essential.

People cannot maintain their spiritual roots and their
connections to the past if the physical world they live in
does not also sustain these roots.
Informal experiments in our communities have led us to believe
that people agree, to an astonishing extent, about the sites
which do embody people's relation to the land and to the past.
It seems, in other words, as though "the" sacred sites for an area
exist as objective communal realities.
If this is so, it is then of course essential that these specific sites
be preserved and made important. Destruction of sites which
have become part of the communal consciousness, in an agreed
and widespread sense, must inevitably create gaping wounds m
the communal body.
Traditional societies have always recognized the importance of
these sites. Mountains are marked as places of special pilgrimage;
rivers and bridges become holy; a building or a tree, or rock or
stone, takes on the power through which people can connect
themselves to their own past.
But modern society often ignores the psychological importance
of these sires. They are bulldozed, developed, changed, for political
and economic reasons, without regard for these simple but
fundamental emotional matters; or they are simply ignored.
We suggest the following two steps.
I. In any geographic area-large or small-ask a large number
of people which sites and which places make them feel the most
contact with the area; which sites stand most for the important
values of the past, and which ones embody their connection to the
land. Then insist that these sites be actively preserved.
 Once the sites are chosen and preserved, embellish them in
I
 SACRED SITES
a way which intensifies their public meaning. We believe that the
best way to intensify a site is through a progression of areas which
people pass through as they approach the site. This is the principle
of "nested precincts," discussed in detail under the pattern
HOLY GROUND  6).
A garden which can be reached only by passing through a series
of outer gardens keeps its secrecy. A temple which can be reached
only by passing through a sequence of approach courts is able to
be a special thing in a man's heart. The magnificence of a mountain
peak is increased by the difficulty of reaching the upper
valleys from which it can be seen; the beauty of a woman is intensified
by the slowness of her unveiling; the great beauty of a
river bank-its rushes, water rats, small fish, wild flowers-are
violated by a too direct approach; even the ecology cannot stand up
to the too direct approach-the thing will simply be devoured.
We must therefore build around a sacred site a series of spaces
which gradually intensify and converge on the site. The site itself
becomes a kind of inner sanctum, at the core. And if the
site is very large-a mountain-the same approach can be taken
with special places from which it can be seen-an inner sanctum,
reached past many levels, which is not the mountain, but a garden,
say, from which the mountain can be seen in special beauty.
Therefore:
Whether the sacred sites are large or small, whether
they are at the center of the towns, in neighborhoods, or
in the deepest countryside, establish ordinances which will
protect them absolutely-so that our roots in the visible
surroundings cannot be violated.

 ACCESS TO WATER*
I
... water is always precious. Among the special natural places
covered by SACRED SITES  ), we single out the ocean beaches,
lakes, and river banks, because they are irreplaceable. Their
maintenance and proper use require a special pattern.

People have a fundamental yearning for great bodies of
water. But the very movement of the people toward the
water can also destroy the water.
Either roads, freeways, and industries destroy the water's edge
and make it so dirty or so treacherous that it is virtually inaccessible;
or when the water's edge is preserved, it falls into private
hands.
Access to water is blocked.
But the need that people have for water is vital and profound.
(See, for example, C. G. Jung, Symbols of Transformation, where
Jung takes bodies of water which appear in dreams as a consistent
representation of the dreamer's unconscious.)
The problem can be solved only if it is understood that people
will build places near the water because it is entirely natural; but
that the land immediately along the water's edge must be preserved
for common use. To this end the roads which can destroy
the water's edge must be kept back from it and only allowed
near it when they lie at right angles to it.
 ACCESS TO WATER
Life forms around the water's edge.
The width of the belt of land along the water may vary with
the type of water, the density of development along it, and the
ecological conditions. Along high density development, it may
be no more than a simple stone promenade. Along low density development,
it may be a common parkland extending hundreds of
yards beyond a beach.
Therefore:
When natural bodies of water occur near human settlements,
treat them with great respect. Always preserve a
belt of common land, immediately beside the water. And
allow dense settlements to come right down to the water
only at infrequent intervals along the water's edge.

 LIFE CYCLE*

... a real community provides, in full, for the balance of human
experience and human life-COMMUNITY OF   I ). To a
lesser extent, a good neighborhood will do the same-IDENTIFIABLE
NEIGHBORHOOD  ). To fulfill this promise, communities
and neighborhoods must have the range of things which life can
need, so that a person can experience the full breadth and depth
of life in his community.

All the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players:
They have their exits and their entrances;
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages.
As, first the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
And then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then the soldier,
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
\\Tith eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.
(Shakespeare, As Yott Like It, II.viii.)
To live life to the fullest, in each of the seven ages, each age
must be clearly marked, by the community, as a distinct wellmarked
time. And the ages will only seem clearly marked if the
 LIFE CYCLE
ceremonies which mark the passage from one age to the next are
firmly marked by celebrations and distinctions.
By contrast, in a fl.at suburban culture the seven ages are not
at all clearly marked; they are not celebrated; the passages from
one age to the next have almost been forgotten. Under these conditions,
people distort themselves. They can neither fulfill themselves
in any one age nor pass successfully on to the next. Like
the sixty-year-old woman wearing bright red lipstick on her
wrinkles, they cling ferociously to what they never fully had.
This proposition hinges on two arguments.
A. The cycle of life is a definite psychological reality. It consists
of discrete stages, each one fraught with its own difficulties,
each one with its own special advantages.
B. Growth from one stage to another is not inevitable, and, in
fact, it will not happen unless the community contains a balanced
life cycle.
A. The Reality of the Life Cycle.
Everyone can recognize the fact that a person's life traverses
several stages-infancy to old age. What is perhaps not so well
understood is the idea that each stage is a discrete reality, with
its own special compensations and difficulties; that each stage has
certain characteristic experiences that go with it.
The most inspired work along these lines has come from Erik
Erikson: "Identity and the Life Cycle," in Psychological Issues,
Vol. , No. , New York: International Universities Press, 59;
and Childhood and Society, New York: W. W. Norton, 50.
Erikson describes the sequence of phases a person must pass
through as he matures and suggests that each phase is characterized
by a specific developmental task-a successful resolution of
some life conflict-and that this task must be solved by a person
before he can move wholeheartedly forward to the next phase.
Here is a summary of the stages in Erikson's scheme, adapted
from his charts:
I. Trust vs. mistrust: the infant; relationship between the
infant and mother; the struggle for confidence that the environment
will nourish.
 Autonomy vs. shame and doubt: the very young child; relationship
between the child and parents; the struggle to stand on
TOWNS
one's own two feet, to find autonomy in the face of experiences
of shame and doubt as to one's capacity for self-control.
 Initiative vs. guilt: the child; relationship to the family,
the ring of friends; the search for action, and the integrity of
one's acts; to make and eagerly learn, checked by the fear and
guilt of one's own aggressions.
 Industry vs. inferiority: the youngster; relationship to the
neighborhood, the school; adaptation to the society's tools; the
sense that one can make things well, alone, and with others,
against the experience of failure, inadequacy.
 Identity vs. identity diffusion: youth, adolescence; relationship
to peers and "outgroups" and the search for models of
adult life; the search for continuity in one's own character against
confusion and doubt; a moratorium; a time to find and ally oneself
with creeds and programs of the world.
 Intimacy vs. isolation: young adults; partners in friendship,
sex, work; the struggle to commit oneself concretely in relations
with others; to lose and find oneself in another, against isolation
and the avoidance of others.
 Generativity vs. stagnation: adults; tne relationship between
a person and the division of labor, and the creation of a
shared household; the struggle ro establish and guide, to create,
against the failure to do so, and the feelings of stagnation.
 Integrity vs. despair: old age; the relationship between a
person and his world, his kind, mankind; the achievement of
wisdom; love for oneself and one's kind; to face death openly,
with the forces of one's life integrated; vs. the despair that life
has been useless.
B. But growth through the life cycle is not inevitable.
It depends on the presence of a balanced community, a community
that can sustain the give and take of growtn. Persons at
each stage of life have sornetning irreplaceable to give and to take
from tne community, and it is just these transactions which help
a person to solve the problems that beset each stage. Consider
the case of a young couple and their new child. The connection
between them is entirely mutual. Of course, the child "depends"
on the parents to give the care and love that is required to resolve
the conflict of trust that goes with infancy. But simultaneously,
 LI FE CYCLE
the child gives the parents the experience of raising and bearing,
which helps them to meet their conflict of generativity, unique to
adulthood.
We distort the situation if we abstract it in such a way that we
consider the parent as "having" such and such a personality when
the child is born and then, remaining static, impinging upon a poor
little thing. For this weak and changing little being moves the whole
family along. Babies control and bring up their families as much as
they are controlled by them; in fact, we may say that the family
brings up a baby by being brought up by him. Whatever reaction patterns
are given biologically and whatever schedule is predetermined
developmentally must be considered to be a series of potentialities for
changing patterns of mutual regulation. [Erikson, ibid. p. .]
Similar patterns of mutual regulation occur between the very
old and the very young; between adolescents and young adults,
children and infants, teenagers and younger teenagers, young men
and old women, young women and old men, and so on. And
these patterns must be made viable by prevailing social institutions
and those parts of the environment which help to maintain them
-the schools, nurseries, homes, cafes, bedrooms, sports fields,
workshops, studios, gardens, graveyards ....
We believe, however, that the balance of settings which allow
normal growth through the life cycle has been breaking down.
Contact with the entire cycle of life is less and less available to
each person, at each moment in time. In place of natural communities
with a balanced life cycle we have retirement villages,
bedrooms suburbs, teenage culture, ghettos of unemployed, college
towns, mass cemeteries, industrial parks. Under such conditions,
one's chances for solving the conflict that comes with each stage
in the life cycle are slim indeed.
To re-create a community of balanced life cycles requires, first
of all, that the idea take its place as a principal guide in the development
of communities. Each building project, whether the
addition to a howe, a new rnad, a clinic, can be viewed as either
helping or hindering the right balance for local communities. We
suspect that the community repair maps, discussed in The Oregon
Experiment, Chapter V Volume  in this series), can play an
especially useful role in helping to encourage the growth of a
balanced Ii fe cycle.
But this pattern can be no more than an indication of work

I.







TOWNS
that needs to be done. Each community must find ways of taking
stock of its own relative "balance" in this respect, and then define
a growth process which will move it in the right direction. This
is a tremendously interesting and vital problem; it needs a great
deal of development, experiment, and theory. If Erikson is right,
and if this kind of work does not come, it seems possible that the
development of trust, autonomy, initiative, industry, identity, intimacy,
generativity, integrity may disappear entirely.

Therefore:
Make certain that the full cycle of life is represented and
balanced in each community. Set the ideal of a balanced
life cycle as a principal guide for the evolution of communities.
This means:
I. That each community include a balance of people at
every stage of the life cycle, from infants to the very
old; and include the full slate of settings needed for
all these stages of life;
 That the community contain the full slate of settings
which best mark the ritual crossing of life from one
stage to the next.

LIFE CYCLE )-so it must also adjust itself and its activities to
the balance of the sexes, and provide, in equal part, the things
which reflect the masculine and feminine sides of life.

The world of a town in the 7o's is split along sexual
lines. Suburbs are for women, workplaces for men; kindergartens
are for women, professional schools for men; supermarkets
are for women, hardware stores for men.
Since no aspect of life is purely masculine or purely feminine,
a world in which the separation of the sexes is extreme, distorts
reality, and perpetuates and solidifies the distortions. Science is
dominated by a masculine, and often mechanical mentality; foreign
diplomacy is governed by war, again the product of the
masculine ego. Schools for young children are swayed by the
world of women, as are homes. The house has become the domain
of woman to such a ridiculous extreme that home builders and
developers portray an image of homes which are delicate and
perfectly "nice," like powder rooms. The idea that such a home
could be a place where things are made or vegetables grown, with
sawdust around the front door, is almost inconceivable.
The pattern or patterns which could resolve these problems are,
for the moment, unknown. We can hint at the kinds of buildings
and land use and institutions which would bring the problem
into balance. But the geometry cannot be understood until certain
social facts are realized, and given their full power to influence
the environment. In short, until both men and women are able to
mutually influence each part of a town's life, we shall not know
what kinds of physical patterns will best co-exist with this social
order.
Therefore:

 ECCENTRIC NUCLEUS*
... so far, we have established an overall height restriction on
the city, with its attendant limitation on average density-FOURSTORY
LIMIT 1). If we assume, also, that the city contains
major centers for every 00, people, spaced according to the
rules in MAGIC OF THE CITY 0), it will then follow that the
overall density of the city slopes off from these centers: the highest
density near to them, the lowest far away. This means that
any individual COMMUNITY OF   will have an overall
density, given by its distance from the nearest downtown. The
question then arises: How should density vary locally, within this
community; what geometric pattern should the density have?
The question is complicated greatly by the principle of SUBCULTURE
BOUNDARY ), which requires that communities are surrounded
by their services, instead of having their services at their
geometric centers. This pattern, and the next, defines a local
distribution of density which is compatible with this context.

The random character of local densities confuses the identity
of our communities, and also creates a chaos in the pattern
of land use.
Let us begin by considering the typical configuration of the
residential densities in a town. There is an overall slope to the
densities: they arc high toward the center and lower toward the
outskirts. But there is no recognizable structure within this overall
slope: no clearly visible repeating pattern we can see again and
again within the city. Compare this with the contours of a mountain
range. In a mountain range, there is a great deal of recognizable
structure; we see systematic ridges and valleys, foothills,
bowls, and peaks which have arisen naturally from geological
processes; and all this structure is repeated again and again, from
place to place, within the whole.
 ECCENTRIC NUCLEUS
Of course, this is only an analogy. But it does raise the question:
Is it natural, and all right, if density configurations in a town
are so random; or would a town be better off if there was some
more visible coherent structure, some kind of systematic variation
in the pattern of the densities?
What happens when the local densities in a town vary in their
present rambling, incoherent fashion r The high density areas,
potentially capable of supporting intense activity cannot actually
do so because they are too widely spread. And the low density
areas, potentially capable of upporting silence and tranquility
when they are concentrated, are also too diffusely scattered. The
result: the town has neither very intense activity, nor very intense
quiet. Since we have many arguments which show how vital it is
for a town to give people both intense activity, and also deep and
satisfying quiet-SACRED SITES  ) ACTIVITY NODES  0))
PROMENADE 1), QUIET BACKS ), STILL WATER 1)-it
seems quite likely, then, that this randomness of density does
harm to urban life.
We believe, indeed, that a town would be far better off if it
did contain a coherent pattern of densities. We present a systematic
account of the factors which might naturally influence the
pattern of density-in the hope of showing what kind of coherent
pattern might be sensible and useful. The argument has five steps.
I. We may assume, reasonably, that some kind of center,
formed by local services, will occur at least once in every community
of 000. This center will typically be the kind we have
called a SHOPPING STREET 2). In WEB OF SHOPPING  we
have shown that shopping streets occur about once for every
I 0, persons.
 From the arguments presented in SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY
(13), we know that this center of activity, since it is a service,
should occur in the boundary between subcultures, should help
to form the boundary between subcultures, and should therefore
be located in the area of the boundary-not inside the community,
but between communities.
 We know, also, that this center must be in just that part of
the boundary which is closest to the center of the larger town or
city. This follows from a dramatic and little known series of
results which show that catch basins of shopping centers are not
circles, as one might na·ively suppose, but half-circles, with the
half-circle on that side of the center away from the central city,
because people always go to that shopping center which lies toward
the center of their city, never to the one which lies toward the
city's periphery.

Brennan's catch basins.
This phenomenon was originally discovered by Brennan in his
post-war studies of Wolverhampton T. Brennan, Midland City,
London: Dobson, I 48). It has, since then, been confirmed and
studied by several writers, most notably Terence Lee, "Perceived
Distance as a Function of Direction in the City," Environment and
Behavior, June 70, 0- I. Lee has shown that the phenomenon
is not only caused by the fact that people are simply more familiar
with the roads and paths that lie toward the center, and use them
more often, but that their very perception of distance varies with
direction, and that distances along lines toward the center are seen
as much shorter than distances along lines away from the center.
Since we certainly want the community to correspond with
the catch basin of its "center" it is essential, then, that the center
be placed off-center-in fact, at that point in the community
which lies toward the center of the larger city. This is, of course,
compatible with the notion discussed already, that the center
should lie in the boundary of the community .

Eccentric centers.
 ECCENTRIC NUCLEUS
 Even though the center lies on one side of the community,
forming a boundary of the community, we may also assume that
the center does need to bulge into the community just a little.
This follows from the fact that, even though services do need to
be in the boundary of the community, not in its middle, still,
people do have some need for the psychological center of their
community to be at least somewhere toward the geometric center
of gravity. It we make the boundary bulge toward the geometric
center, then this axis will naturally form a center-and, further,
its catch basin, according to the data given above, will correspond
almost perfectly with the community.

 Finally, although we know that the center needs to be

is low-the center will be small. At the center of the city, where
the overall density is higher, it will be larger, because the greater
density of population supports more services. In both cases, it
will be in the boundary. If it is too large to be contained at one
point, it will naturally extend itself along the boundary, but still
within the boundary, thus forming a lune, a partial horseshoe,
long or short, according to its position in the greater city.
A partial lzorseshoe.

These rules are rather simple. If we follow them, we shall find
a beautiful gradient of overlapping imbricated horseshoes, not unlike
the scales of a fish. If the city gradually gets this highly
coherent structure, then we can be sure that the articulation of
dense areas, and areas of little density, will be so clear that both
activity and guiet can exist, each intense, unmixed, and each
available to everyone.
Therefore:
Encourage growth and the accumulation of density to
form a clear configuration of peaks and valleys according
to the following rules:
 Consider the town as a collection of communities of
 These communities will be between ¼ mile
across and  miles across, according to their overall
density.
 Mark that point in the boundary of each community
which is closest to the nearest major urban center.
This point will be the peak of the density, and the
core of the "eccentric" nucleus.
 Allow the high density to bulge in from the boundary,
toward the center of gravity of the community, thus
enlarging the eccentric nucleus toward the center.
 Continue this high density to form a ridge around
the boundary in horseshoe fashion-with the length
of the horseshoe dependent on the overall mean gross
density, at that part of the city, and the bulge of the
horseshoe toward the center of the region, so that the
horseshoes form a gradient, according to their position
in the region. Those close to a major downtown
are almost complete; those further away are only half
complete; and those furthest from centers are
shrunken to a point.

 DENSITY RINGS*
... in ECCENTRIC NUCLEUS   we have given a general form
for the configuration of density "peaks" and "valleys," with respect
to the MOSAIC OF SUBCULTURES  and SUBCULTURE
BOUNDARIES  I ). Suppose now that the center of commercial
activity in a COMMUNITY OF   is placed according to the
prescriptions of ECCENTRIC NUCLEUS  ), and according to the
overall density within the region. We then face the problem of
establishing local densities, for house clusters and work communities,
at different distances around this peak. This pattern
gives a rule for working out the gradient of these local densities.
Most concretely, this gradient of density can be specified, by
drawing rings at different distances from the main center of
activity and then assigning different densities to each ring, so
that the densities in the succeeding rings create the gradient of
density. The gradient will vary from community to communityboth
according to a community's position in the region, and according
to the cultural background of the people.
People want to be close to shops and services, for excitement
and convenience. And they want to be away from
services, for quiet and green. The exact balance of these
two desires varies from person to person, but in the aggregate
it is the balance of these two desires which determines
the gradient of housing densities in a neighborhood.
In order to be precise about the gradient of housing densities,
let us agree at once, to analyze the densities by means of three
concentric semi-circular rings, of equal radial thickness, around
the main center of activity.
[We make them semi-circles, rather than full circles, since it has
been shown, empirically, that the catch basin of a given local

center is a half-circle, on the side away from the city-see discussion
in ECCENTRIC NUCLEUS  and the references to Brennan
and Lee given in that pattern. However, even if you do not
accept this finding, and wish to assume that the circles are full
circles, the following analysis remains essentially unchanged.] We
now define a density gradient, as a set of three densities, one for
each of the three rings.
, de11sity gradient.
Imagine that the three rings of some actual neighborhood have
densities D , D2, D • And assume, now, that a new person moves
into this neighborhood. As we have said, within the given density
gradient, he will choose to live in that ring, where his liking
for green and quiet just balances his liking for access to shops
and public services. This means that each person is essentially
faced with a choice among three alternative density-distance combinations:
Ring I. The density D , with a distance of about R  to shops.
Ring . The density D , with a distance of about R  to shops.
Ring . The density D , with a distance of about R to shops.
Now, of course, each person will make a different choice-according
to his own personal preference for the balance of density
and distance. Let us imagine, just for the sake of argument, that
all the people in the neighborhood are asked to make this choice
(forgetting, for a moment, which houses are available). Some will
I
TOWNS
choose ring , some ring , and some ring . Suppose that N1
choose ring I, N choose ring , and N  choose ring . Since the
three rings have specific, well-defined areas, the numbers of people
who have chosen the three areas, can be turned into hypothetical
densities. In other words, if we in imagination distribute the
people among the three rings according to their choices, we can
work out the hypothetical densities which would occur in the
three rings as a result.
Now we are suddenly faced with two fascinating possibilities:
I. These new densities are different from the actual densities.
II. These new densities are the same as the actual densities.
Case I is much more likely to occur. But this is unstable-since
people's choices will tend to change the densities. Case II, which
is less likely to occur, is stable-since it means that people, choosing
freely, will together re-create the very same pattern of density
within which they have made these choices. This distinction is
fundamental.
If we assume that a given neighborhood, with a given total
area, must accommodate a certain number of people given by the
average density of people at that point in the region), then there
is just one configuration of densities which is stable in th is
sense. We now describe a compntational procedure which can be
used to obtain this stable density configuration.
Before we explain the computational procedure, we must explain
how very fundamental and important this kind of stable
density configuration is.
In today's world, where density gradients are usually not
stable, in our sense, most people are forced to live under conditions
where the balance of quiet and activity does not correspond
to their wishes or their needs, because the total number of
available houses and apartments at different distances is inappropriate.
What happens, then, is that the rich, who can afford to pay
for what they want, are able to find houses and apartments with
the balance that they want; the not so rich and poor are forced
to take the leavings. All this is made legitimate by the middleclass
economics of "ground rent"-the idea that land at different
distances from centers of activity, commands different prices,
because more or less people want to be at those distances. But
actually the fact of differential ground rent is an economic
 DENSITY RINGS
mechanism which springs up, within an unstable density configuration,
to compensate for its instability.
We want to point out that in a neighborhood with a stable
density configuration stable in our sense of the word), the land
would not need to cost different prices at different distances,
because the total available number of houses in each ring would
exactly correspond to the number of people who wanted to live at
those distances. With demand equal to supply in every ring, the
ground rents, or the price of land, could be the same in every
ring, and everyone, rich and poor, could be certain of having
the balance they require.
We now come to the problem of computing the stable densities
for a given neighborhood. The stability depends on very subtle
psychological forces; so far as we know these forces cannot be
represented in any psychologically accurate way by mathematical
equations, and it is therefore, at least for the moment, impossible
to give a mathematical model for the stable density. Instead, we
have chosen to use the fact that each person can make cnoices
about his required balance of activity and quiet, and to use
people's choices, within a simple game, as the source of the
computation. In short, we have constructed a game, which allows
one to obtain the stable density configuration within a few
minutes. This game essentially simulates the behavior of the real
system, and is, we believe, far more reliable than any mathematical
computation.
DENSITY GRADIENTS GAME
 First draw a map of the three concentric half rings. Make it
a half-circle--if you accept the arguments of ECCENTRIC NUCLEUS
(28)-otherwise a full circle Smooth this half-circle to fit the horseshoe
of the highest density-mark its center as the center of that
horseshoe.
 H the overall radius of the half-circle is R, then the mean radii
of the three rings are Ri,R,,R  given by:
R = R/6
R, = R/6
R = R/6
 Make up a board for the game, which has the three concentric
circles shown on it, with the radii marked in blocks, so people can
understand them easily, i.e.,  ooo feet =  blocks.
 Decide on the total population of this neighborhood. This is

TOWNS
the same as settling on an overall average net density for the area. It
will have to be roughly compatible with the overall pattern of density
in the region. Let us say that the total population of the community
is N families.
 Find ten people who are roughly similar to the people in the
community-vis-a-vis cultural habits, background, and so on. If possible,
they should be ten of the people in the actual community itself.
 Show the players a set of photographs of areas that show typical
best examples of different population densities in families per
gross acre), and leave these photographs on display throughout the
game so that people can use them when they make their choices.
 Give each player a disk, which he can place on the board in
one of the three rings.
 Now, to start the game, decide what percentage of the total
population is to be in each of the three rings. It doesn't matter what
percentages you choose to start with-they will soon right themselves
as the game gets under way-but, for the sake of simplicity, choose
multiples of  per cent for each ring, i.e.,  per cent in ring , 0
per cent in ring ,  per cent in ring .
 Now translate these percentages into actual densities of families
per net acre. Since you will have to do this many times during the
course of the game, it is advisable to construct a table which translates
percentages directly into densities. You can make up such a table by
inserting the values for N and R which you have chosen for your
community into the formulae below. The formulae are based on the
simple arithmetic of area, and population. R is expressed in hundreds
of yards-roughly in blocks. The densities are expressed in families
per gross acre. Multiply each ring density by a number between
and 0, according to the per cent in that ring. Thus, if there are 0
per cent in ring , the density there is  times the entry in the formulae,
or N/57rR •

 o. Once you have found the proper densities, from the formulae,
write them on three slips of paper, and place these slips into their
appropriate rings, on the game board.
 The slips define a tentative density configuration for the community.
Each ring has a certain typical distance from the center.
And each ring has a density. Ask people to look carefully at the pictures
which represent these densities, and then to decide which of the
three rings gives them the best balance of quiet and green, as against
access to shops. Ask each person to place his disk in the ring he
chooses.
 DENS I TY RINGS
, . When all ten disks are on the board, this defines a new distribution
of population. Probably, it is different from the one you
started with. Now make up a new set of percentages, half-way between
the one you originally defined, and the one which people's
disks define, and, again, round off the percentages to the nearest 0
per cent. Here is an example of the way you can get new percentages.
Old percentages People's disks New percentages
10%  = 0%   0%
30% =40%   0%
60%  = 0%   so%
As you see, the new ones are not perfectly half-way between the other
two-but as near as you can get, and still have multiples of ten.
 Now go back to step , and go through , 0, u,  again
and again, until the percentages defined by people's disks are the same
as the ones you defined for that round. If you turn these last stable
percentages into densities, you have found the stable density configuration
for this community. Stop, and have a drink all round.
In our experiments, we have found that this game reaches a
stable state very quickly indeed. Ten people, in a few minutes,
can define a stable density distribution. We have presented the
results of one set of games in the table which follows below.

It is essential to recognize that the densities given Ill this
table cannot wisely be used just as they stand. The figures will
vary with the exact geometry of the neighborhood and with
different cultural attitudes in different subcultures. For th is
reason, we consider it essential that the people of a given community,
who want to apply this pattern, play the game themselves,
in order to find a stable gradient of densities for their
own situation. The numbers we have given above are more for
the sake of illustration than anything else.
Therefore:
Once the nucleus of a community is clearly placeddefine
rings of decreasing local housing density around this
nucleus. If you cannot avoid it, choose the densities from
the foregoing table. But, much better, if you can possibly
manage it, play the density rings game, to obtain these
densities, from the intuitions of the very people who are
going to live in the community.
Within the rings of density, encourage housing to take the
form of housing clusters-self-governing cooperatives of  to I
households, their physical size varying according to the densityHOUSE
CLUSTER   ). According to the densities in the different
rings, build these houses as free-standing houses-HOUSE CLUSTER

"stars" begin to form, where the most important paths meet.
These stars are potentially the vital spots of a community. The
growth of these stars and of the paths which form them need to
be guided to form genuine community crossroads.
❖ + ❖
Community facilities scattered individually through the
city do nothing for the life of the city.
One of the greatest problems in ex1stmg comrnurnt1es is the
fact that the available public life in them is spread so thin that it
has no impact on the community. It is not in any real sense
available to the members of the community. Studies of pedestrian
behavior make it clear that people seek out concentrations of other
people, whenever they are available for instance, Jan Gehl,
"Mennesker til Fods Pedestrians)," Arkitekten, No. 0, 68).
To create these concentrations of people in a community,
facilities must be grouped densely round very small public sguares
which can function as nodes-with all pedestrian movement in
the community organized to pass through these nodes. Such nodes
require four properties.
First, each node must draw together the main paths in the
surrounding community. The major pedestrian paths should
converge on the square, with minor paths funneling into the
major ones, to create the basic star-shape of the pattern. This is
much harder to do than one might imagine. To give an example
of the difficulty which arises when we try to build this relationship
into a town, we show the following plan-a scheme of
JO ACTIVITY NODES
ours for housing in Peru-in which the paths are all convergent
on a very small number of squares.
Public paths converge on centers of action.
This is not a very good plan-it is too stiff and formal. But
it is possible to achieve the same relationship in a far more relaxed
manner. In any case the relationship between paths, community
facilities, and squares is vital and hard to achieve. It must be
taken seriously, from the very outset, as a major feature of the
city.
Second, to keep the activity concentrated, it is essential to make
the squares rather small, smaller than one might imagine. A
square of about  X  feet can keep the normal pace of public
life well concentrated. This figure is discussed in detail under
SMALL PUBLIC SQUARE   I).
Third, the facilities grouped around any one node must be
chosen for their symbiotic relationships. It is not enough merely
to group communal functions in so-called community centers. For
example, church, cinema, kindergarten, and police station are
all community facilities, but they do not support one another
mutually. Different people go to them, at different times, with
different things in mind. There is no point in grouping them
together. To create intensity of action, the facilities which are
placed together round any one node must function in a cooperative
manner, and must attract the same kinds of people, at the
same times of day. For example, when evening entertainments are
grouped together, the people who are having a night out can
use any one of them, and the total concentration of action increases-
see NIGHT LIFE  3). When kindergartens and small
parks and gardens are grouped together, young families with
children may use either, so their total attraction is increased.
Fourth, these activity nodes should be distributed rather evenly
TOWNS
across the community, so that no house or workplace is more
than a few hundred yards from one. In this way a contrast of
"busy and quiet" can be achieved at a small scale-;rnd large
dead Heas can be avoided.
Nodes of different size.
Therefore:
Create nodes of act1v1ty throughout the community,
spread about  yards apart. First identify those existing
spots in the community where action seems to concentrate
itself. Then modify the layout of the paths in the community
to bring as many of them through these spots as
possible. This makes each spot function as a "node" in the

JO ACTIVITY NODES
path network. Then, at the center of each node, make a
small public square, and surround it with a combination of
community facilities and shops which are mutually supportive.

Connect those centers which are most dense, with a wider,
more important path for strolling-PROMENADE   I ; make
special centers for night activities-NIGHT LIFE 3); whenever
new paths are built, make certain that they pass through the
centers, so that they intensify the life still further-PATHS AND
GOALS  I 0); and differentiate the paths so they are wide near
the centers and smaller away from them-DEGREES OF PUBLICNESS
(36). At the heart of every center, build a small public
square-SMALL PUBLIC SQUARES 1), and surround each square
with an appropriate mix of mutually self-reinforcing facilitiesWORK

... assume now that there is an urban area, subdivided into
subcultures and communities each with its boundaries. Each subculture
in the MOSAIC OF SUB CUL TURES  ), and each COM MUNITY
OF   I  has a promenade as its backbone. And each
promenade helps to form ACTIVITY NODES  0 along its length,
by generating the flow of people which the activity nodes need
in order to survive.
❖ ❖ +
Each subculture needs a center for its public life: a place
where you can go to see people, and to be seen.
The promenade, "paseo," "passegiata," evening stroll, is common
in the small towns of Italy, Spain, Mexico, Greece, Yugoslavia,
Sicily, and South America. People go there to walk up
and down, to meet their friends, to stare at strangers, and to let
strangers stare at them.
Throughout history there have been places in the city where
people who shared a set of values could go to get in touch with
each other. These places have always been like street theaters:
they invite people to watch others, to stroll and browse, and to
loiter:
In Mexico, in any small town plaza every Thursday and Sunday
night with the band playing and the weather mild, the boys walk
this way, the girls walk that, around and around, and the mothers
and fathers sit on iron-scrolled benches and watch. Ray Bradbury,
"The girls walk this way; the boys walk that way ... " West, Los
Angeles Times Sunday Magazine, April , 70.)
In all these places the beauty of the promenade is simply this:
people with a shared way of life gather together to rub shoulders
and confirm their community.
ls the promenade in fact a purely Latin institution  Our experiments
suggest that it is not. The fact is that the kinds of
promenades where this strolling happens are not common in a
city, and they are especially uncommon in a sprawling urban
region. But experiments by Luis Racionero at the Department of
TOWNS
Architecture at the University of California, Berkeley, have
shown that wherever the possibility of this public contact does
exist, people will seek it, as long as it is close enough. Racionero
interviewed   people in several parts of San Francisco, living
various distances from a promenade, and found that people who
lived within  minutes used it, while people who lived more
than  minutes away did not.

Use the promenade


Do not use
the promenade

It seems that people, of all cultures, may have a general need
for the kind of human mixing which the promenade makes
possible; but that if it is too far, the effort to get there simply
outweighs the importance of the need. In short, to make sure that
all the people in a city can satisfy this need, there must be
promenades at frequent intervals.
Exactly how frequent should they be? Racionero establishes 0
minutes as the upper limit, but his survey does not investigate
frequency of use. We know that the closer the promenade is, the
more often people will use it. We guess that if the promenade is
within ro minutes or less, people will use it often-perhaps even
once or twice a week.
The relation between the catch basin of the promenade, and
the actual physical paved area of the promenade itself, is extremely
critical. We show in PEDESTRIAN DENSITY ), that
places with less than one person for every I  to  square feet
of paved surface, will seem dead and uninviting. It is therefore
essential to be certain that the number of people who might,
typically, be out strolling on the promenade, is large enough to
maintain this pedestrian density along its length. To check th is
relation, we calculate as follows:
A IO-minute walk amounts to roughly  feet  feet per
minute), which is probably also about the right length for the
promenade itself. This means that the catch basin for a promenade
has a shape roughly like this:

JI PROMENADE
A promenade and its catch basin.
This area contains   acres. If we assume an average density of
 people per gross acre, then there are , people in the
area. If one-fifth of this population uses the promenade once a
week, for an hour between  and Io p.111., then at any given
moment between those hours, there are some I oo people on the
promenade. If it is I  feet long, at  square feet per person,
it can therefore be  feet wide, at the most, and would be better
if it were closer to Io feet wide. It is feasible, but only just.
We see then, that a promenade I  feet long, with the catch
basin we have defined and the population density stated, should
be able to maintain a lively density of activity, provided that it
is not more than about  feet wide. We want to emphasize that
a promenade will not work unless the pedestrian density is high
enough, and that a calculation of this kinrl must always be made
to check its feasibility.
The preceding figures arc meant to be illustrative. They establish
a rough order of magnitude for promenades and th.cir catch
basin populations. But we have also seen successful promenades for
populations of  a fishing village in Peru); and we have seen
a promenade for ,000, Las Ramblas in Barcelona). They
both work, although they are very different in character. The
small one with its catch basin of  works, because the cultural
habit of the paseo is so strong there, a higher percentage
of the people use it more often, and the density of people on
the promenade is less than we would imagine-it is so beautiful
that people enjoy it even if it is not so crowded. The large one
works as a citywide event. People are willing to drive a long
distance to it-they may not come as often, but when they do, it
is worth the ride-it is exciting-packed-teeming with people.
We imagine the pattern of promenades in a city to be just as
varied-a continuum ranging from small local promenades serv-

TOWNS
ing  people to large intense ones serving the entire city-each
different in character and density of action.
Finally, what are the characteristics of a successful promenade?
Since people come to see people and to be seen, a promenade
must have a high density of pedestrians using it. It must therefore
be associated with places that in themselves attract people,
for example, clusters of eating places and small shops.
A promenade in Paris.
Further, even though the real reasons for coming might have
to do with seeing people and being seen, people find it easier
to take a walk if they have a "destination." This destination may
be real, like a coke shop or cafe, or it may be partly imaginary,
"let's walk round the block." But the promenade must provide
people with a strong goal.
It is also important that people do not have to walk too far between
the most important points along the promenade. Informal
observation suggests that any point which is more than   feet
from activity becomes unsavory and unused. In short, good
promenades are part of a path through the most active parts of
the community; they are suitable as destinations for an evening
walk; the walk is not too long, and nowhere on it desolate: no
point of the stroll is more than   feet from a hub of activity.
A variety of facilities will function as destinations along the
promenade: ice cream parlors, coke shops, churches, public
gardens, movie houses, bars, volleyball courts. Their potential
will depend on the extent to which it is possible to make provisions
for people to stay: widening of pedestrian paths, planting of trees,
walls to lean against, stairs and benches and niches for sitting,

JI PROMENADE
opening of street fronts to provide sidewalk cafes, or displays of
activities or goods where people might like to linger.
Therefore:
Encourage the gradual formation of a promenade at the
heart of every community, linking the main activity nodes,
and placed centrally, so that each point in the community
is within IO minutes' walk of it. Put main points of attraction
at the two ends, to keep a constant movement up and
down.
 minute walk
No matter how large the promenade is, there must be enough
people coming to it to make it dense with action, and this can be
precisely calculated by the formula of PEDESTRIAN DENSITY  I ).
The promenade is mainly marked by concentrations of activity
along its length-ACTIVITY NODES 0); naturally, some of these
will be open at night-NIGHT LIFE    ; and somewhere on
the promenade there will be a concentration of shops-SHOPPING
STREET   ). It might also be appropriate to include CARNIVAL
(58 and DANCING IN THE STREET 3 in very large promenades.

  SHOPPING STREET*

... this pattern helps to complete the MAGIC OF THE CITY  r o)
and PROMENADE  r). And, each time a shopping street gets
built, it will also help to generate the IVEil OF SHOPPING  I ).

Shopping centers depend on access: they need locations
near major traffic arteries. However, the shoppers themselves
don't benefit from traffic: they need quiet, comfort,
and convenience, and access from the pedestrian paths in
the surrounding area.
This simple and obvious conlli.ct has almost never been effectively
resolved. On the one hand, we have shopping strips.
Here the shops are arranged along the major traffic arteries, This
is convenient for cars, but it is not convenient for pedestrians. A
strip does not have the characteristics which pedestrian areas
need.
Shopping strip-for cars.
On the other hand, we have those "pre-automobile" shopping
streets in the center of old towns. Here the pedestrians' needs arc
taken into account, at least partially. But, as the town spreads out
and the streets become congested, they are inconvenient to reach;
and again the cars dominate the narrow streets.
The modern solution is the shopping center. They are
usually located along, or near to, major traffic arteries, so they

are convenient for cars; and they often have pedestrian precincts
in them-so that, in theory at least, they are comfortable
and convenient for pedestrians. But they are usually isolated, in
the middle of a vast parking lot, and thereby disconnected from
the pedestrian fabric of the surrounding areas. In short, you cannot
walk to them.
New shopping center-only for cars.
To be convenient for traffic, and convenient for people walking,
and connected to the fabric of the surrounding town, the
shops must be arranged along a street, itself pedestrian, but
opening off a major traffic artery, perhaps two, with parking behind,
or underneath, to keep the cars from isolating the shops
from surrounding areas.
We observed this pattern growing spontaneously in certain
neighborhoods of Lima, Peru: a wide road is set down for automobile
traffic, and the shops begin to form themselves, in
pedestrian streets that are perpendicular off-shoots off this road.

This pattern is also the form of the famous Stroget in
Copenhagen. The Stroget is the central shopping spine for the
city; it is extremely long-almost a mile-and is entirely pedestrian,
only cut periodically by roads which run at right angles to
it.
Therefore:
Encourage local shopping centers to grow in the form of
short pedestrian streets, at right angles to major roads and
opening off these roads-with parking behind the shops, so
that the cars can pull directly off the road, and yet not

  NIGHT LIFE*

... every community has some kind of public night lifeMAGIC
OF THE CITY 0), COMMUNITY OF  ). If there is
a promenade in the community, the night life is probably along
the promenade, at least in part-PROMENADE   I). This pattern
describes the details of the concentration of night time activities.

Most of the city's activities close down at night; those
which stay open won't do much for the night life of the city
unless they are together.
This pattern is drawn from the following seven points:
I. People enjoy going out at night; a night on the town s
something special.
 If evening activities such as movies, cafes, ice cream parlors,
gas stations, and bars are scattered throughout the community,
each one by itself cannot generate enough attraction.
One bar by itself is a lonely place at night.
 Many people do not go out at night because they feel they
have no place to go. They do not feel like going out to a specific
establishment, but they do feel like going out. An evening center,
particularly when it is full of light, functions as a focus for such
people.
 Fear of the dark, especially in those places far away from
one's own back yard, is a common experience, and quite simple to
understand. Throughout our evolution night has been a time to
stay quiet and protected, not a time to move about freely.

 NIGHT LIFE
A cluster of night spots creates life in the street.
 Nowadays this instinct is anchored in the fact that at night
street crimes are most prevalent in places where there are too few
pedestrians to provide natural surveillance, but enough pedestrians
to make it worth a thief's while, in other words, dark, isolated
night spots invite crime. A paper by Shlomo Angel, "The Ecology
of Night Life" Center for Environmental Structure, Berkeley,
1968), shows the highest number of street crimes occurring in
those areas where night spots are scattered. Areas of very low or
very high night pedestrian density are subject to much less crime.
No. of crimes V\ )
Pedestrian density
Isolated night spots invite crime.
 It is difficult to estimate the exact number of night spots that
need to be grouped to create a sense of night life. From observation,
we guess that it takes about six, minimum.
 On the other hand, massive evening centers, combining
evening services which a person could not possibly use on the same
night, are alienating. For example, in New York the Lincoln
Center for the Performing Arts makes a big splash at night, but it
makes no sense. No one is going to the ballet and the theater
and a concert during one night on the town. And centralizing
these places robs the city as a whole of several centers of night
life.

TOWNS
All these arguments together suggest small, scattered centers of
mutually enlivening night spots, the services grouped to form
cheery squares, with lights and places to loiter, where people can
spend several hours in an interesting way. Here are some examples
of small groups of mutually sustaining night activities.
A movie theater, a restaurant and a bar, and a bookstore open
till midnight; a smoke shop.
A laundromat, liquor store and cafe; and a meeting hall and
beer hall.
Lodge hall, bowling alley, bar, playhouse.
A terminal, a diner, hotels, nightclubs, casinos.
Therefore:
Knit together shops, amusements, and services which
are open at night, along with hotels, bars, and all-night
diners to form centers of night life: well-lit, safe, and lively
places that increase the intensity of pedestrian activity at
night by drawing all the people who are out at night to
the same few spots in the town. Encourage these evening
centers to distribute themselves evenly across the town.

 INTERCHANGE
... this pattern defines the points which generate the WEB OF
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION( I ). It also helps to complete LOCAL
TRANSPORT AREAS II by guaranteeing the possibility of interchanges
at the center of each transport area, where people can
change from their bikes, or local mini-buses, to the long distance
transit lines that connect different transport areas to one another.

Interchanges play a central role in public transportation.
Unless the interchanges are working properly, the public
transportation system will not be able to sustain itself.
Everyone needs public transportation sometimes. But it is the
steady users who keep it going. If the steady users do not keep it
going, then there is no system for the occasional user. To maintain
a steady flow of users, interchanges must be extremely convenient
and easy to use: r. Workplaces and the housing for people who
especially need public transportation must be distributed rather
evenly around interchanges. . The interchanges must connect up
with the surrounding flow of pedestrian street life. . It must be
easy to change from one mode of travel to another.
In more detail:
I. Workers are the bread and butter of the transportation
system. If the system is to be healthy, all the workplaces in town
must be within walking distance of the interchanges. Furthermore,
the distribution of workplaces around interchanges should
be more or less even-see SCATTERED WORK ). When they are
concentrated around one or two, the rush hour flow crowds the
trains, and creates inefficiencies in the system as a whole.
Furthermore, some of the area around interchanges should be
given over to houses for those people who rely entirely on public
transportation-especially old people. Old people depend on
public transportation; they make up a large proportion of the
system's regular users. To meet their needs, the area around interchanges
must be zoned so that the kind of housing that suits
them will develop there-OLD PEOPLE EVERYWHERE  0).
J INTERCHANGE
 The interchange must be convenient for people walking
from their homes and jobs, and it must be safe. People will not
use an interchange if it is dingy, derelict, and deserted. This
means that the interchange must be continuous with local pedestrian
life. Parking lots must be kept to one side, so that people do
not have to walk across them to get to the station. And there must
be enough shops and kiosks in the interchange, to keep a steady
flow of people moving in and out of it and through it.
 If the system is going to be successful, there must be no
more than a few minutes' walk- feet at the most-between
points of transfer. And the distance should decrease as the trips
become more local: from bus to bus, I oo feet maximum; from
rapid transit to bus,  feet maximum; from train to rapid
transit,  feet maximum. In rainy climates the connecting
paths should be almost entirely covered-ARCADES  19). What's
more, the most important transfer connections should not involve
crossing streets: if necessary sink the roads or build bridges to
make the transfer smooth.
For details on the organization of interchanges, see " Requirements
for Rapid Transit Stations," Center for Environmental
Structure, I 64, partly published in "Relational Complexes in
Architecture" Christopher Alexander, Van Maren King, Sara
Ishikawa, Michael Baker, Architectural Record, September 66,
pp. 5-90).
Therefore:
At every interchange in the web of transportation follow
these principles:
I. Surround the interchange with workplaces and housing
types which specially need public transportation.
 Keep the interior of the interchange continuous with
the exterior pedestrian network, and maintain this
continuity by building in small shops and kiosks and
by keeping parking to one side.
 Keep the transfer distance between different modes
of transport down to  feet wherever possible, with
an absolute maximum of  feet.

 HOUSEHOLD MIX*

... the mix of households in an area does almost more than
anything else to generate, or destroy, the character of an IDENTIFIABLE
NEIGHBORHOOD ), of a HOUSE CLUSTER ), of a
WORK COMMUNITY 1), or, most generally of all, of a LIFE
CYCLE  ). The question is, what kind of mix should a wellbalanced
neighborhood contain/
No one stage in the life cycle is self-sufficient.
People need support and confirmation from people who have
reached a different stage in the life cycle, at the same time that
they also need support from people who arc at the same stage as
they are themselves.
However, the needs which generate separation tend to overwhelm
the need for mixture. Present housing patterns tend to
keep different types of households segregated from each other.
There are vast areas of two-bedroom houses, other areas of studio
and one-bedroom apartments, other areas of three- and four-bedroom
houses. This means that we have corresponding areas of
single people, couples, and small families with children, segregated
by type.
The effects of household segregation are profound. ln the
pattern LIFE CYCLE  ), we have suggested that normal growth
through the stages of life requires contact, at each stage, with
people and institutions from all the other ages of man. Such contact
is completely foiled if the housing mix in one's neighborhood
is skewed toward one or two stages only. On the other hand,
when the balance of life cycles is well related to the kinds of housing
that are available in a neighborhood, the possibilities for contact
become concrete. Each person can find in the face-to-face
life of his neighborhood at least passing contact with people from
every stage of life. Teenagers see young couples, old people watch
the very young, people living a-lone draw sustenance from large
families, youngsters look to the middle-aged for models, and so
on: it is all a medium through which people feel their way
through life.
TOWNS
This need for a mix of housing must be offset against the need
to be near people similar in age and way of life to oneself. Taking
these two needs together, what is the right balance for the housing
mix?
The right balance can be derived straightforwardly from the
statistics of the region. First, determine the percentage of each
household type for the region as a whole; second, use the same
percentages to guide the gradual growth of the housing mix
within the neighborhood. For example, if  per cent of a metropolitan
region's households are families,  per cent are couples,
 per cent arc individuals, and Io per cent group households,
then we would expect the houses in each neighborhood to have
roughly the same balance.
Let us ask, finally, how large a group should the mix be applied
to? We might try to create a mix in every house obviously
absurd), or in every cluster of a dozen houses, or in every neighborhood,
or merely in every town this last has almost no significant
effect). We believe that the mix will only work if it exists
in a human group small enough to have some internal political
and human intercourse-this could be a cluster of a dozen
families, or a neighborhood of  people.
Therefore:
Encourage growth toward a mix of household types in
every neighborhood, and every cluster, so that one-person
households, couples, families with children, and group
households are side by side.

 DEGREES OF PUBLICNESS**
... within the neighoorhoods-JDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD
( I )-there are naturally some areas where life is rather concentrated
ACTIVITY NODES  0), others where it is slower, and others
in between-DENSITY RINGS  ). It is essential to diff eren ti ate
groups of houses and the paths which lead to them according to
this gradient.
People are different, and the way they want to place
their houses in a neighborhood is one of the most basic
kinds of difference.
Some people want to live where the action is. Others want
more isolation. This corresponds to a basic human personality dimension,
which could be called the "extrovert-introvert" dimension,
or the "community loving-privacy loving" dimension. Those
who want the action like being near services, near shops, they
like a lively atmosphere outside their houses, and they are happy
to have strangers going past their houses all the time. Those who
want more isolation like being away from services and shops, enjoy
a very small scale in the areas outside their houses, and don't want
strangers going past their houses. See for example, Nancy Marshall,
"Orientations Toward Privacy: Environmental and Personality
Components," James Madison College, Michigan State
University, East Lansing, Michigan.)
The variation of different people along the extrovert-introvert
dimension is very well described by Frank Hendricks and Malcolm
MacNair in "Concepts of Environmental Quality Standards
Based on Life Styles," report to the American Public Health
Association, February I , 69, pp. I -r . The authors identify
several kinds of persons and characterize each by the relative
amount of time spent in extroverted activities and in introverted
activities. Francis Loetterle has shed further light on the problem
in "Environment Attitudes and Social Life in Santa Clara
County," Santa Clara County Planning Department, San Jose,

TOWNS
California, 67. He asked   households how far they wanted
to be from various community services. The results were:  per
cent of the households interviewed wanted to be located less than
three blocks from commercial centers;  per cent wanted to be
located between four and six blocks away;  per cent wanted to
be located more than six blocks away mean block size in Santa
Clara County is   yards). The exact distances apply only to
Santa Clara. But the overall result overwhelmingly supports our
contention that people vary in this way and shows that they have
quite different needs as far as the location and character of houses
is concerned.
To make sure that the different kinds of people can find houses
which satisfy their own particular desires, we suggest that each
cluster of houses, and each neighborhood should have three kinds
of houses, in about equal numbers: those which are nearest to the
action, those which are half-way between, and those which are
almost completely isolated. And, to support this pattern we need,
also, three distinct kinds of paths:
I. Paths along services, wide and open for activities and
crowds, paths that connect activities and encourage busy through
traffic.
 Paths remote from services, narrow and twisting, to discourage
through traffic, with many at right angles and dead ends.
 Intermediate types of paths linking the most remote and
quiet paths to the most central and busy ones.
This pattern is as important in the design of a cluster of a few
houses as it is in the design of a neighborhood. When we were
helping a group of people to design their own cluster of houses,
we first asked each person to consider his preference for location
on the basis of extrovert-introvert. Three groups emerged: four
"extroverts" who wished to be as near the pedestrian and com,munity
action as possible, four "introverts" who desired as much
remoteness and privacy as possible, and the remaining four who
wanted a bit of both, The site plan they made, using this pattern,
is shown below, with the positions which the three kinds of
people chose.

Make a clear distinction between three kinds of homes
-those on quiet backwaters, those on busy streets, and
those that are more or less in between. Make sure that those
on quiet backwaters are on twisting paths, and that these
houses are themselves physically secluded; make sure that
the more public houses are on busy streets with many
people passing by all day long and that the houses themselves
are relatively exposed to the passers-by. The inbetween
houses may then be located on the paths half-way
between the other two. Give every neighborhood about
equal numbers of these three kinds of homes.

 HOUSE CLUSTER**

... the fundamental unit of organization within the neighborhood-
IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD  )-is the cluster of a
dozen houses. By varying the density and composition of different
clusters, this pattern may also help to generate DENSITY RINGS
(29), HOUSEHOLD MIX ), and DEGREES OF PUBLICNESS ).

People will not feel comfortable in their houses unless
a group of houses forms a cluster, with the public land between
them jointly owned by all the householders.
When houses are arranged on streets, and the streets owned by
the town, there is no way in which the land immediately outside
the houses can reflect the needs of families and individuals living
in those houses. The land will only gradually get shaped to meet
their needs if they have direct control over the land and its
repair.
This pattern is based on the idea that the cluster of land and
homes immediately around one's own home is of special importance.
It is the source for gradual differentiation of neighborhood
land use, and it is the natural focus of neighborly interaction.
Herbert Gans, in The Levittowners New York: Pantheon,
1967), has collected some powerful evidence for th is tendency.
Gans surveyed visiting habits on a typical block tract development.
Of the I  people he surveyed, all of them were engaged
in some pattern of regular visiting with their neighbors. The
interesting finding is the morphology of this visiting pattern.
Consider the following diagram-one like it can be made for
almost every house in a tract. There is a house on either side, one
or two across the street, and one directly behind, across a garden
fence.
Ninety-three per cent of all the neighborhood visiting engaged
in by the subject, is confined to thi11patial clwter.
J HOUSE CLUSTER
On a typical block each home is
at t!,e center of its own cluster.
And when asked "Whom do you visit most?"  per cent
said the people they visit most are immediately across the street
or next door.
The beauty of this finding is its indication of the strength of
the spatial cluster to draw people together into neighborly contact.
The most obvioUJ and tribal-like cluster-the homes on
either side and across the street-forms roughly a circle, and it
is there that most contact occurs. And if we add to this shape
the home immediately behind, although it is separated by private
gardens and a fence, we can account for nearly all the visiting
that goes on in the Levi ttown neighborhood.
We conclude that people continue to act according to the
laws of a spatial cluster, even when the block layout and the
neighborhood plan do their best to destroy this unit and make it
anonymoUJ.
Gans' data underscore our intuitions: people want to be part
of a neighborly spatial cluster; contact between people sharing
such a cluster is a vital function. And this need stands, even
when people are able to drive and see friends all over the city.
What about the size of the cluster? What is the appropriate
size' In Gans' investigations each home stands at the center of
a cluster of five or six other homes. But this is certainly not a
natural limit for a housing cluster since the Levittown block layouts
are so confining. In our experience, when the siting of the
homes is attuned to the cluster pattern, the natural limit arises
entirely from the balance between the informality and coherence
of the group.

TOWNS
The clusters seem to work best if they have between  and I
houses each. With one representative from each family, this is
the number of people that can sit round a common meeting table,
can talk to each other directly, face to face, and can therefore
make wise decisions about the land they hold in common. With
 or Io households, people can meet over a kitchen table, exchange
news on the street and in the gardens, and generally,
without much special attention, keep in touch with the whole of
the group. When there are more than  or I  homes forming
a cluster, this balance is strained. We therefore set an upper
limit of around I  on the number of households that can be
naturally drawn into a cluster. Of course, the average size for
clusters might be less, perhaps around  or ; and clusters of ,
4, or  homes can work perfectly well.
Now, assuming that a group of neighbors, or a neighborhood
association, or a planner, wants to give some expression to this
pattern, what are the critical issues/
First, the geometry. In a new neighborhood, with houses built
on the ground, we imagine quite dramatic clusters, with the
houses built around or to the side of common land; and with a
core to the cluster that gradually tapers off at the edges.
A cluster of r  houses.
In existing neighborhoods of free-standing houses, the pattern
must be brought into play gradually by relaxing zoning ordinances,
and allowing people to gradually knit together clusters
out of the existing grid-see COMMON LAND  and THE
FAMILY 5). It is even possible to implement the pattern with

 HOUSE CLUSTER
ROW HOUSES  and HOUSING HILLS ). In this case the configuration
of the rows, and the wings of the apartment building,
form the cluster.
In all cases common land which is shared by the cluster is an
essential ingredient. It acts as a focus and physically knits the
group together. This common land can be as small as a path or as
large as a green.
On the other hand, care must be taken not to make the
clusters too tight or self-contained, so that they exclude the
larger community or seem too constricting and claustrophobic.
There needs to be some open endedness and overlapping among
clusters.
--..-..  - -
·- ..•. ....
Overlapping clusters in a Turkish vitlage.
Along with the shape of the cluster, the way in which it is
owned is critical. If the pattern of ownership is not in accord
with the physical properties of the clu1ter, the pattern will not
take hold. Very simply, the cluster must be owned and maintained
by its constituent households. The households must be able to
organize themselves as a corporation, capable of owning all the
common land they share. There are many examples of tiny,
user-owned housing corporations such as this. We know several
places in our region where such experiments are under way, and
places where they have been established for many years. And we
have heard, from visitors to the Center, of similar developments
in various parts of the world.
We advocate a system of ownership where the deed to one
home carries with it part ownership in the cluster to which the
home belongs; and ideally, this in turn carries with it part owner-

TOWNS
ship in the neighborhood made up of several clusters. In this way,
every owner is automatically a shareholder in several levels of
public land. And each level, beginning with the homes in their
clusters, is a political unit with the power to control the processes
of its own growth and repair.
Under such a system, the housing, whether in low or high
density neighborhoods, can gradually find its way toward an
abiding expression of the cluster. And the clusters themselves
will come to support a quality of neighborhood life that, from our
broken down neighborhoods now, we can only dimly perceive.
The unavowed secret of man is that he wants to be confirmed in
his being and his existen·ce by his fellow men and that he wishes them
to make it possible for him to confirm them, and ... not merely in
the family, in the party assembly or in the public house, but also in
the course of neighborly encounters, perhaps when he or the other
steps out of the door of his house or to the window of his house and
the greeting with which they greet each other will be accompanied by
a glance of well-wishing, a glance in which curiosity, mistrust, and
routine will have been overcome by a mutual sympathy: the one
gives the other to understand that he affirms his presence. This is the
indispensable minimum of humanity. Martin Buber, Gleanings, New
York: Simon and Schuster, 69, p. 4.)
Therefore:
Arrange houses to form very rough, but identifiable
clusters of  to  households around some common land
and paths. Arrange the clusters so that anyone can walk
through them, without feeling like a trespasser.

 ROW HOUSES*

in certain parts of a community, the detached homes and
gardens of a HOUSE CLUSTER    will not work, because they
are not dense enough to generate the denser parts of DENSITY
RINGS   and DEGREES OF PUBLICNESS  ). To help create
these larger patterns, it is necessary to build row houses instead.

At densities of  to  houses per acre, row houses are
essential. But typical row houses are dark inside, and
stamped from an identical mould.
Above  houses per acre, it is almost impossible to make houses
freestanding without destroying the open space around them;
the open space which is left gets reduced to nothing more than
shallow rings around the houses. And apartments do not solve
the problem of higher densities; they keep people off the ground
and they have no private gardens.
Row houses solve these problems. But row houses, in their
conventional form, have problems of their own. Conventional
row houses all conform, approximately, to the following diagram.
The houses have a short frontage and a long depth, and share the
party wall along their long side.
Typical row h?use pattern.
Because of the long party walls, many of the rooms are poorly
lit. The houses lack privacy there is nowhere in th:e houses or
their yards I hat is very far from a party wall. The small yards
are made even worse by the fact that they are at the short ends
of the house, so that only a small part of the indoor space can be

adjacent to the garden. And there is almost no scope for individual
variation in the houses, with the result that terraces of
row houses are often rather sterile.
These four problems of row houses can easily be solved by
making the houses long and thin, along the paths, like cottages.
In this case, there is plenty of room for subtle variations from
house to house-each plan can be quite different; and it is easy
to arrange the plan to let the light in.
Houses long and thin along the path.
This kind of house has  per cent of its perimeter fixed and
 per cent free for individual variations. A house in a conventional
terrace of row houses has  per cent of its perimeter
fixed and only  per cent open to individual variations. So the
house can take on a variety of shapes, with a guarantee of a reasonable
amount of privacy for its garden and for most of the house,
an increase in the amount of light into the house, and an increase
in the amount of indoor space that can be next to outdoor areas.
Crinkling and variation.
These advantages of the long thin row house are so obvious, it
1s natural to wonder why they aren't used more often. The
reason is, of course, that roads do not permit it. So long as
houses front directly onto roads, i.t is imperative that they have

  ROW HOUSES
the shortest frontage possible, so as to save the cost of roads and
services-the cost of roads is a large part of any housing budget.
But in the pattern we propose, we have been able to avoid this
difficulty altogether, by making the houses front only onto paths
-which don't cost much-and it is then these paths which
connect to the roads, at right angles, in the way prescribed by
NETWORK OF PATHS AND CARS   ).
Roads away from houses.
Finally, a word on density. As we see from the sketch below,
it is possible to build a two-story house of I  square feet on an
area  x 0, using a total area path, house, garden of about
I  square feet, and it is even possible to manage with an
absolute minimum of IOOO square feet.
I
r  oo square feet of land per house.
It is therefore possible to build row houses at a density of 0
per net acre. Without parking, or with less parking, this figure
could conceivably be even higher.
Therefore:

TOWNS
For row houses, place houses along pedestrian paths that
run at right angles to local roads and parking lots, and give
each house a long frontage and a shallow depth.

the paths as possible-LONG THIN HOUSE 09); vary the houses

 HOUSING HILL
:._.-.

... at the still higher densities required in the inner ring of
the community's DENSITY RINGS  ), and wherever densities
rise above  houses per acre or are four stories high-FouRSTORY
LTMTT   r), the house clusters become like hills.

Every town has places in it which are so central and desirable
that at least 0- households per acre will be living
there. But the apartment houses which reach this density
are almost all impersonal.
In the pattern YOUR OWN HOME  ), we discuss the fact that
every family needs its own home with land to build on, land
where they can grow things, and a house which is unique and
clearly marked as theirs. A typical apartment house, with flat
walls and identical windows, cannot provide these qualities.
The form of the HOUSING HILL comes essentially from three
requirements. First, people need to maintain contact with the
ground and with their neighbors, far more contact than high-rise
living permits. Second, people want an outdoor garden or yard.
This is among the most common reasons for their rejecting
apartment living. And third, people crave for variation and
uniqueness in their homes, and this desire is almost always constrained
by high-rise construction, with its regular fa ades and
identical units.
I. Connection to the ground and to neighbors. The strongest
evidence comes from D. M. Fanning "Families in Flats,"
British Medical Journal, November 67, pp. 2-86). Fanning
shows a direct correlation between incidence of mental disorder
and high-rise living. These findings are presented in detail in
FOUR-STORY LIMIT   I). High-rise living, it appears, has a terrible
tendency to leave people alone, stranded, in their apartments.
Home life is split away from casual street life by elevators, hallways,
and long stairs. The decision to go out for some public life
becomes formal and awkward; and unless there is some specific
task which brings people out in the world, the tendency is to
stay home, alone.

 HOUSING HILL
Fanning also found a striking lack of communication between
families in the high-rise flats he studied. Women and children
were especially isolated. The women felt they had little reason
to take the trip from their apartment to the ground, except to
go shopping. They and their children were effectively imprisoned
in their apartments, cnt off from the ground and from
their neighbors.
Contact is impossible.
It seems as if the ground, the common ground between houses,
is the medium through which people are able to make contact
with one another and with themselves. Living on the ground, the
yards around houses join those of the neighbors, and, in the best
arrangements, they also adjoin neighborhood byways. Under these
conditions it is easy and natural to meet with people. Children
playing in the yard, the flowers in the garden, or just the
weather outside provide endless topics for conversations. This
kind of contact is impossible to maintain in high-rise apartments.
 Private gardens. In the Park Hill survey J. F. Demars,
"Park Hill Survey," 0.A.P., February 66, p. ), about
one-third of the high-rise residents interviewed said they missed
the chance to putter around in their garden.
The need for a small garden, or some kind of private outdoor
space, is fundamental. It is equivalent, at the family scale, to the
biological need that a society has to be integrated with its country-
 I I
TOWNS
side-crrY COUNTRY FINGERS ). In all traditional architeL
tures, wherever building is essentially in the hands of the people,
there is some expression of this need. The miniature gardens of
Japan, outdoor workshops, roof gardens, courtyards, backyard
rose gardens, communal cooking pits, herb gardens-there are
thousands of examples. But in modern apartment structures this
kind of space is s;mply not available.
 Identity of each unit. During the course of a seminar held
at the Center for Environmental Structure, Kenneth Radding
made the following experiment. He asked people to draw their
dream apartment, from the outside, and stuck the drawing on a
small piece of cardboard. He then asked them to place the cardboard
on a grid representing the b,ade of a huge apartment
house, and asked them to move their "homes" around, until they
liked the position they were in. Without fail, people wanted
their apartments to be on the edge of the building, or set off
from other units by blank walls. No one wanted his own apartment
to be lost in a grid of apartments.
In another survey we visited a nineteen-story apartment
building in San Francisco. The building contained  apartments
each with a balcony. The management had set very rigid
restrictions on the use of these balconies-no political posters,
no painting, no clothes drying, no mobiles, no barbecues, no
tapestries. But even when confined by such restrictions, over half
of the residents were still able, in some way, to personalize their
balconies with plants in pots, carpets, and furniture. In short, in
the face of the most extreme regimentation people try to give
their a;nrtments a unique face.
What building form is compatible with these three basic
requirements' First of all, to maintain a strong and direct connection
to the ground, the building must be no higher than
four stories-FOUR-STORY LIMIT   I). Also, and perhaps more
important, we believe that each "house" must be within a few
steps of a rather wide and gradual stair that rises directly from
the ground. If he stair is open, somewhat rambling, and very
gradual, it will be continuous with the street and the life of the
street. Furthermore, if we take this need seriously, the stair mnst
be connected at the ground to a piece of land, owned in common

 HOUSING HILL
by the residents-this land organized to form a semi-private
green.
Concerning the private gardens. They need sunlight and
privacy-two requirements hard to satisfy in ordinary balcony
arrangements. The terraces must be sou th-facing, large, and
intimately connected to the houses, and solid enough for earth,
and bushes, and small trees. This suggests a kind of housing hill;
with a gradual slope toward the south and a garage for parking
below the "hill."
And for identity-the only genuine solution to the problem
of identity is to let each family gradually build and rebuild its
own home on a terraced superstructure. If the floors of this
structure are capable of supporting a house and some earth, each
unit is free to take its own character and develop its own tiny
garden.
Although these requirements bring to mind a form similar to
Safdie's Habitat, it is imp rtant to realize that Habitat fails to
solve two of the three problem discussed here. It has private
gardens; but it fails to solve the problem of connection to the
ground-the units are strongly separated from the casual life of
the street ;-and the mass-produced dwellings are anonymous,
far from unique.

 OLD PEOPLE
EVERYWHERE**

. . . when neighborhoods are properly formed they give the people
there a cross section of ages and stages of development-IDENTIFIABLE
NEIGHBORHOOD  I ), LIFE CYCLE  ), HOUSEHOLD
MIX    ; however, the old people are so often forgotten and
left alone in modern society, that it is necessary to formulate a
special pattern which underlines their needs.

Old people need old people, but they also need the
young, and young people need contact with the old.
There is a natural tendency for old people to gather together
in clusters or communities. But when these elderly communities
are too isolated or too large, they damage young and old alike.
The young in other parts of town, have no chance of the benefit
of older company, and the old people themselves are far too isolated.
Treated like outsiders, the aged have increasingly clustered together
for mutual support or simply to enjoy themselves. A now familiar
but still amazing phenom·enon has sprung up in the past
decade: dozens of good-sized new towns that exclude people under
 . Built on cheap, outlying land, such communities offer two-bedroom
houses starting at $18, plus a refuge from urban violence ...
and generational pressures. Time, August , 70.)
But the choice the old people have made by moving to these
communities and the remarks above are a serious and painful reflection
of a very sad state of affairs in our culture. The fact is
that contemporary society shunts away old people; and the more
shunted away they are, the deeper the rift between the old and
young. The old people have no choice but to segregate themselves
-they, like anyone else, have pride; they would rather not be
with younger people who do not appreciate them, and they feign
satisfaction to justify their position.
And the segregation of the old causes the same rift inside each
individual life: as old people pass into old age communities their
ties with their own past become unacknowledged, lost, and there-

 OLD PEOPLE EVERYWHERE
fore broken. Their youth is no longer alive in their old age-the
two become dissociated; their lives are cut in two.
In contrast to the situation today, consider how the aged were
respected and needed in traditional cultures:
Some degree of prestige for the aged seems to have been practically
universal in all known societies. This is so general, in fact, that it cuts
across many cultural factors that have appeared to determine trends
in other topics related to age. The Role of Aged in Primitive Society,
Leo W. Simmons, New Haven: Yale University Press, 45,
p. .)
More specifically:
... Another family relationship of great significance for the aged
has been the commonly obserl.'.ed intimate association between the very
young and the very old. Frequently they have been left together at
home while the able-bodied have gone forth to earn the family living.
These oldsters, in their wisdom and experience, have protected
and instructed the little ones, while the children, in turn, have acted
as the "eyes, ears, hands, and feet" 0f their feeble old friends. Care
of the young has thus very generally provided the aged with a useful
occupation and a vivid interest in life during the long dull days of
senescence. Ibid. p. 9.)
Clearly, old people cannot be integrated socially as in traditional
cultures unless they are first integrated physically-unless
they share the same streets, shops, services, and common land with
everyone else. But, at the same time, they obviously need other
old people around them; and some old people who are infirm
need special services.
And of course old people vary in their need or desire to be
among their own age group. The more able-bodied and independent
they are, the less they need to be among other old people,
and the farther they can be from special medical services. The
variation in the amount of care they need ranges from complete
nursing care; to semi-nursing care involving house calls once a
day or twice a week; to an old person getting some help with
shopping, cooking, and cleaning; to an old person being completely
independent. Right now, there is no such fine differentia-

TOWNS
tion made in the care of old people-very often people who
simply need a little help cooking and cleaning are put into rest
homes which provide total nursing care, at huge expense to them,
their families, and the community. It is a psychologically debilitating
situation, and they turn frail and helpless because that
is the way they are treated.
We therefore need a way of taking care of old people which
provides for the full range of their needs:
r. It must allow them to stay in the neighborhood they know
best-hence some old people in every neighborhood.
 It must allow old people to be together, yet in groups small
enough not to isolate them from the younger people in the neighborhood.
 It must allow those old people who are independent to live
independently, without losing the benefits of communality.
 It must allow those who need nursing care or prepared
meals, to get it, without having to go to nursing homes far from
the neighborhood.
All these requirements can be solved together, very simply, if
every neighborhood contains a small pocket of old people, not
concentrated all in one place, but fuzzy at the edges like a swarm
of bees. This will both preserve the symbiosis between young and
old, and give the old people the mutual support they need within
the pockets. Perhaps  might live in a central group house,
another r o or r  in cottages close to this house, but interlaced
with other houses, and another r o to r  also in cottages, still
further from the core, in among the neighborhood, yet always
within I oo or  yards of the core, so they can easily walk there
to play chess, have a meal, or get help from the nurse.
The number  comes from Mumford's argument:
The first thing to be determined is the number of aged people to
be accommodated in a neighborhood unit; and the answer to this, I
submit, is that the normal age distribution in the community as a whole
should be maintained. This means that there should be from five to
eight people over sixty-five in every hundred people; so that in a
neighborhood unit of, say, six hundred people, there would be between
thirty and fifty old people. Lewis Mumford, The Human
Prospect, New York, 68, p. .)
As for the character of the group house, it might vary from

 OLD PEOPLE EVERYWHERE
case to case. In some cases it might be no more than a commune,
where people cook together and have part-time help from young
girls and boys, or professional nurses. However, about  per cent
of the nation's elderly need full-time care. This means that two
or three people in every  will need complete nursing care.
Since a nurse cm typically work with six to eight people, this
suggests that every second or third neighborhood group house
might be equipped with complete nursing care.
Therefore:
Create dwellings for some  old people in every neighborhood.
Place these dwellings in three rings ...
 A central core with cooking and nursing provided.
 Cottages near the core.
 Cottages further out from the core, mixed among the
other houses of the neighborhood, but never more
than  yards from the core.
in such a way that the  houses together form a single

... according to the pattern SCATTERED WORK ), work is entirely
decentralized and woven in and out of housing areas. The
effect of SCATTERED WORK-can be increased piecemeal, by building
individual work communities, one by one, in the boundaries
between the neighborhoods; these work communities will then
help to form the boundaries-SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY  I ),
NEIGHBORHOOD BOUNDARY  I  )-and above all in the boundaries,
they will help to form ACTIVITY NODES 0).
If you spend eight hours of your day at work, and eight
hours at home, there is no reason why your workplace
should be any less of a community than your home.
When someone tells you where he "lives," he is always talking
about his house or the neighborhood his house is in. It sounds
harmless enough. But think what it really means. Why should the
people of our culture choose to use the word "live," which, on the
face of it applies to every moment of our waking lives, and apply
it only to a special portion of our lives-that part associated with
our families and houses. The implication is straightforward. The
people of our culture believe that they are less alive when they
are working than when they are at home; and we make this
distinction subtly clear, by choosing to keep the word "live" only
for those places in our lives where we are not working. Anyone
who uses the phrase "where do you live" in its everyday sense,
accepts as his own the widespread cultural awareness of the fact
that no one really "lives" at his place of work-there is no song
or music there, no love, no food-that he is not alive while
working, not living, only toiling away, and being dead.
As soon as we understand this situation it leads at once to outrage.
Why should we accept a world in which eight hours of the
day are "dead"; why shall we not create a world in which our
work is as much part of life, as much alive, as anything we do at
home with our family and with our friends?
This problem is discussed in other patterns-SCATTERED WORK
(9), SELF-GOVERNING WORKSHOPS AND OFFICES 0). Here we

TOWNS
focus on the implications which this problem has for the physical
and social nature of the area in which a workplace sits. If a person
spends eight hours a day working in a certain area, and the
nature of his work, its social character, and its location, are all
chosen to make sure that he is living, not merely earning money,
then it is certainly essential that the area immediately around his
place of work be a community, just like a neighborhood but oriented
to the pace and rhythms of work, instead of the rhythms
of the family.
For workplaces to function as communities, five relationships
are critical:
I. Workplaces must not be too scattered, nor too agglomerated,
but clustered in groups of about r .
We know from SCATTERED WORK  that workplaces should
be decentralized, but they should not be so scattered that a single
workplace is isolated from others. On the other hand, they
should not be so agglomerated that a single workplace is lost in
a sea of others. The workplaces should therefore be grouped to
form strongly identifiable communities. The communities need
to be small enough so that one can know most of the people working
in them, at least by sight-and big enough to support as many
amenities for the workers as possible-lunch counters, local sports,
shops, and so on. We guess the right size may be between  and
 establishments.
 The workplace community contains a mix of manual jobs,
desk joD.r, craft jobs, selling, and so forth.
Most people today work in areas which are specialized: medical
buildings, car repair, advertising, warehousing, financial, etc. This
kind of segregation leads to isolation from other types of work and
other types of people, leading in turn to less concern, respect, and
understanding of them. We believe that a world where people
.are socially responsible can only come about where there is a value
intrinsic to every job, where there is dignity associated with all
work. This can hardly come about when we are so segregated
from people who do different kinds of work from us.
 There is a common piece of land within the work community,
which ties the individual workshops and offices together.
A shared street does a little to tie individual houses and places
together; but a shared piece of common land does a great deal

 WORK COMMUNITY
more. If the workplaces are grouped around a common courtyard
where people can sit, play volleyball, eat lunches, it will help the
contact and community among the workers.
 The work community is interlaced with the larger community
in which it is located.
A work community, though forming a core community by itself,
cannot work well in complete isolation from the surrounding
community. This is already discussed to some extent in SCATTERED
WORK   and MEN AND WOMEN  ). In addition, both
work community and residential community can gain by sharing
facilities and services-restaurants, cafes, libraries. Thus it makes
sense for the work community to be open to the larger community
with shops and cafes at the seam between them.
 Finally, it is necessary that the common land, or courtyards,
exist at two distinct and separate levels. On the one hand,
the courtyards for common table tennis, volleyball, need half-adozen
workgroups around them at the most-more would swamp
them. On the other hand, the lunch counters and laundries and
barbershops need more like  or  workgroups to survive. For
this reason the work community needs two levels of clustering.
Therefore:
Build or encourage the formation of work communities
-each one a collection of smaller clusters of workplaces
which have their own courtyards, gathered round a larger
common square or common courtyard which contains
shops and lunch counters. The total work community
should have no more than  or  workplaces in it.

 INDUSTRIAL RIBBON*
., . '. .
( ..,.

in a city where work is decentralized by SCATTERED WORK
( ), the placing of industry is of particular importance since it
usually needs a certain amount of concentration. Like WORK COMMUNITIES
( I), the industry can easily be placed to help in the
formation of the larger boundaries between subcultures-suBCULTURE
BOUNDARY  I J).

Exaggerated zoning laws separate industry from the
rest of urban life completely, and contribute to the plastic
unreality of sheltered residential neighborhoods.
It is true, obviously, that industry creates smoke, smells, noise,
and heavy truck traffic; and it is therefore necessary to prevent
the heaviest industry, especially, from interfering with the calm
and safety of the places where people live.
But it is also true that in the modern city industry gets treated
like a disease. The areas where it exists are assumed to be dirty
and derelict. They are kept to the "other side of the tracks,"
swept under the rug. And people forget altogether that the things
which surround them in their daily lives-bread, chemicals, cars,
oil, gaskets, radios, chairs-are all made in these forbidden industrial
zones. Under these conditions it is not surprising that
people treat life as an unreal charade, and forget the simplest
realities and facts of their existence.
Since the 3o's various efforts have been made, on behalf of
the workers, to make factories green and pleasant. This social welfare
approach to the nature of industries is once again unreal, in
the opposite direction. A workshop, where things are being made,
is not a garden or a hospital. The gardens which surround the
new industrial "parks" are more for show than for the workers
anyway since a few small inner courts or gardens would be far
more useful to the workers themselves. And the contribution of
an industrial park to the social and emotional life of the surrounding
city is almost nil.
What is needed is a form of industry which is small enough
so that it does not need to be so sharply segregated; genuine, so
that it seems like a workshop, because it is a workshop; placed

m such a way that the truck traffic which it generates does not
endanger nearby neighborhoods; and formed along the edge of
neighborhoods so that it is not a dangerous, forgotten zone, but
so that it is a real part of life, accessible to children from the
surrounding houses, woven into the fabric of city life, in a way
that properly reflects its huge importance in the scheme of things.
But many industries are not small. They need large areas to
function properly. A survey of planned industrial districts shows
that  I.  per cent of the industries require o to  .o acres,  .6
per cent require  to IO acres, and . per cent require Io to
acres. Robert E. Boley, Industrial Districts Restudied: An Analysis
of Characteristics, Urban Land Institute, Technical Bulletin
No. 1, 61. These industries can only fit into a NEIGHBORHOOD
BOUNDARY    or SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY    if the
boundary is wide enough. Ribbons whose width varies between
 and  feet, with sites varying in length between  and
 feet, will be able to provide the necessary range of one to
25-acre sites in compact blocks, and are still narrow enough to keep
communities on opposite sides of the ribbon reasonably connected.
The industrial ribbons require truck access and some rail transport.
Truck roads and rail spurs should always be located in the
center of the ribbon, so that the edges of the ribbon remain open

to the community. Even more important, the ribbons must be
placed so that they do not generate a heavy concentration of
dangerous and noisy truck traffic tlzrough neighborhoods. Since
most truck traffic comes to and from the freeways, this means
that the industrial ribbons must be placed fairly near to RING
ROADS  I ).
Therefore:
Place industry in ribbons, between  and  feet wide,
which form the boundaries between communities. Break
these ribbons into long blocks, varying in area between
and  acres; and treat the edge of every ribbon as a place
where people from nearby communities can benefit from
the offshoots of the industrial activity.

 UNIVERSITY AS
A MARKETPLACE
... the NETWORK OF LEARNING  I  has established the importance
of a whole society devoted to the learning process with
decentralized opportunities for learning. The network of learning
can be greatly helped by building a university, which treats
the learning process as a normal part of adult life, for all the people
in society.
Concentrated, cloistered univers1t1es, with closed admission
policies and rigid procedures which dictate who may
teach a course, kill opportunities for learning.
The original universities in the middle ages were simply collections
of teachers who attracted students because they had something
to off er. They were marketplaces of ideas, located all over
the town, where people could shop around for the kinds of ideas
and learning which made sense to them. By contrast, the isolated
and over-administered university of today kills the variety and intensity
of the different ideas at the university and also limits the
student's opportunity to shop for ideas.
To re-create this kind of academic freedom and the opportunity
for exchange and growth of ideas two things are needed.
First, the social and physical environment must provide a
setting which encourages rather than discourages individuality
and freedom of thought. Second, the environment must provide
a setting which encourages the student to see for himself which
ideas make sense-a setting which gives him the maximum opportunity
and exposure to a great variety of ideas, so that he can
make up his mind for himself.
The image which most clearly describes this kind of setting is
the image of the traditional marketplace, where hundreds of tiny
stalls, each one developing some specialty and unique flavor which
can attract people by its genuine quality, are so arranged that a
potential buyer can circulate freely, and examine the wares before
he buys.
 UNIVERSITY AS A MARKETPLACE
What would it mean to fashion the university after this model?
I. Anyone can take a course. To begin with, in a university
marketplace there are no admission procedures. Anyone, at any
age, may come forward and seek to take a class. In effect, the
"course catalog" of the university is published and circulated at
large, in the newspapers and on radio, and posted in public
places throughout the region.
 Anyone can give a course. Similarly, in a university marketplace,
anyone can come forward and offer a course. There is no
hard and fast distinction between teachers and the rest of the
citizenry. If people come forward to take the course, then it is
established. There will certainly be groups of teachers banding
together and offering interrelated classes; and teachers may set
prerequisities and regulate enrollment however they see fit. But,
like a true marketplace, the students create the demand. If over
a period of time no one comes forward to take a professor's course,
then he must change his offering or find another way to make a
living.
Many courses, once they are organized, can meet in homes
and meeting rooms all across the town. But some will need more
space or special equipment, and all the classes will need access to
libraries and various other communal facilities. The university
marketplace, then, needs a physical structure to support its social
structure.
Certainly, a marketplace could never have the form of an isolated
campus. Rather it would tend to be open and public, woven
through the city, perhaps with one or two streets• where university
facilities are concentrated.
In an early version of this pattern, written expressly for the
University of Oregon m Eugene, we described in detail the
physical setting which we believe corn plernents the marketplace
of ideas. We advised:
Make the university a collection of small buildings, situated along
pedestrian paths, each containing one or two educational projects.
Make all the horizontal circulation among these projects, in the public
domain, at ground floor. This means that all projects open directly
to a pedestrian path, and that the upper floors of buildings are
connected directly to the ground, by stairs and entrances. Connect all
the pedestrian paths, so that, like a marketplace, they form one major
pedestrian system, with many entrances and openings off it. The over-
 3
TOWNS
all result of this pattern, is that the environment becomes a collection
of relatively low buildings, opening off a major system of pedestrian
paths, each building containing a series of entrances and staircases, at
about  foot intervals.
We still believe that this image of the university, as a marketplace
scattered through the town, is correct. Most of these details
are given by other patterns, in this book: BUILDING COMPLEX
(  s)' PEDESTRIAN STREET  I 00)' ARCADES  I )' and OPEN
STAIRS ).
Finally, how should a university marketplace be administered?
We don't know. Certainly a voucher system where everyone has
egual access to payment vouchers seems sensible. And some
technigue for balancing payment to class size is reguired, so
teachers are not simply paid according to how many students they
enroll. Furthermore, some kind of evaluation technique is
needed, so that reliable information on courses and teachers
filters out to the towns people.
There are several experiments going forward in higher education
today which may help to solve these administrative questions.
The Open University of England, the various "free" universities,
such as Heliotrope in San Francisco, the  branches of the University
Without Walls all over the United States, the university
extension programs, which gear their courses entirely to working
people-they are all examples of institutions experimenting with
different aspects of the marketplace idea.
Therefore:
Establish the university as a marketplace of higher education.
As a social conception this means that the university
is open to people of all ages, on a full-time, part-time, or
course by course basis. Anyone can offer a class. Anyone
can take a class. Physically, the university marketplace has
a central crossroads where its main buildings and offices
are, and the meeting rooms and labs ripple out from this
crossroads-at first concentrated in small buildings along
pedestrian streets and then gradually becoming more dispersed
and mixed with the town.

 LOCAL TOWN HALL*
... according to COMMUNITY OF  ), the political and
economic life of the city breaks down into small, self-governing
communities. In this case, the process of local government needs
a physical place of work; and the design and placing of this
physical place of work can help to create and to sustain the
COMMUNITY OF  by acting as its physical and social focus.

Local government of communities and local control by
the inhabitants, will only happen if each community has its
own physical town hall which forms the nucleus of its political
activity.
We have argued, in MOSAIC OF SUBCULTURES ), COMMUNITY
OF   I ), and IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD  ), that
every city needs to be made of self-governing groups, which
exist at two different levels, the communities with populations of
 to 0, and the neighborhoods with populations of 00
to 000.
These groups will only have the political force to carry out
their own, locally determined plans, if they have a share of the
taxes which their inhabitants generate, and if the people in the
groups have a genuine, daily possibility of access to the local
government which represents them. Both require that each group
has its own seat of government, no matter how modest, where
the people of the neighborhood feel comfortable, and where they
know that they can get results.
This calls up a physical image of city government which is
quite the opposite of the huge city halls that have been built in
the last   years. A local town hall would contain two basic
features:
r. It is community territory for the group it serves; it is made
in a way which invites people in for service, spontaneously, to
debate policy, and the open space around the building is shaped
to sustain people gathering and lingering.

TOWNS
 It is located at the heart of the local community and s
within walking distance of everyone it serves.
I. The town hall as community territory.
The weakness of community government is due m part to the
kinds of policies created and maintained by the city hall bureaucracy.
And we believe this situation is largely supported and
bolstered by the physical nature of city hall. In other words, the
physical existence of a city hall undermines local community
government, even where the city hall staff is sympathetic to
"neighborhood participation."
The key to the problem lies in the experience of powerlessness
at the community level. When a man goes to city hall to take
action on a neighborhood or community issue, he is at once on
the defensive: the building and the staff of city hall serve the
entire city; his problem is very small beside the problems of the
city as a whole. And besides, everyone is busy-busy and unfamiliar.
He is asked to fill out paper forms and make appointments,
though perhaps the connection between these forms and appointments
and his problem are not very clear. Soon the people in
the neighborhoods feel more and more remote from city hall,
from the center of decision-making and from the decisions themselves
which influence their lives. Quickly the syndrome of powerlessness
grows.
In an earlier publication, we presented a body of evidence to
substantiate the growth of this syndrome
Which Generates Multi-Service Centers, Center for Environmental
Structure, Berkeley, 68, pp. 0-87). There we discovered
that centralized service programs reached very few of
the people in their target areas; the staff of these centers quickly
took on the red tape mentality, even where they were chosen
specifically to support neighborhood programs; and, most damaging
of all, the centers themselves were seen as alien places, and
the experience of using them was, on the whole, debilitating to
the people.
Like all syndromes, this one can only be broken if it is attacked
on its several fronts simultaneously. This means, for example,
organizing neighborhoods and communities to take control of the
functions that concern them; revising city charters to grant

 LOCAL TOWN HALL
power to local groups; and making places, in communities and
neighborhoods, that act as home bases for the consolidation of
this power-the local town halls.
What might these local town halls be like if they are to be
effective in breaking down the syndrome of powerlessness/
The evidence shows that people can and will articulate their
needs if given the proper setting and means. Creating this setting
goes hand in hand with community organization. If the local
town hall is gradually to become a source of real neighborhood
power, it must help the process of community organization. This
means, essentially, that the building be built around the process
of community organization, and that the place be clearly
recognizable as community territory.
When we translate the idea of community organization and
community territory into physical terms, they yield two components:
an arena and a zone of community projects.
The community needs a public forum, equipped with sound
system, benches, walls to put up notices, where people are free
to gather; a place which belongs to the community where people
would naturally come whenever they think something should
be done about something. We call this public forum the arena.
And the community needs a place where people can have
access to storefronts, work space, meeting rooms, office equipment.
Once a group is ready to move, it takes typewriters,
duplicating machines, telephones, etc., to carry through with a
project and develop broad based community support-and this
in turn needs cheap and readily accessible office space. We call
this space the community projects zone-see NECKLACE OF
COMMUNITY PROJECTS  for details.
 The location of local town halls.
If these local town halls are to be successful in drawing people
in, the question of their location must be taken seriously. From
earlier work on the location of multi-service centers, we are
convinced that town halls can die if they are badly located:
twenty times as many people drop into community centers when
they are located near major intersections as when they are
buried in the middle of residential blocks.
Here, for example, is a table which shows the number of

TOWNS
people who dropped in at a service center while it was located
on a residential street, versus the number of people who dropped
in after it was relocated on a major commercial street, close to a
main pedestrian intersection.

The details of this investigation are given in
Which Generates Multi-Service Centers pp. 0-73). The conclusion
reached there, is that community centers can afford to
be within a block of the major pedestrian intersections, but if
they are farther away, they are virtually dead as centers of local
service.
This information must be interpreted to suit the different
scales of neighborhood and community. We imagine, in a
neighborhood of 00, the neighborhood town hall would be
quite small and informal; perhaps not even a separate building at
all, but a room with an adjoining outdoor room, on an important
corner of the neighborhood. In a community of 000, something
more is required: a building the size of a large house, with an
outdoor area developed as a forum and meeting place, located on
the community's main promenade.
Therefore:
To make the political control of local functions real,
establish a small town hall for each community of 000,
and even for each neighborhood; locate it near the busiest
intersection in the community. Give the building three
parts: an arena for public discussion, public services around
the arena, and space to rent out to ad hoc community
projects.

government at the heart of every community. This pattern embellishes
the local town hall and other public institutions like
it-UNIVERSITY AS A MARKETPLACE 3 and HEALTH CENTER
(47)-with a ground for community action.
❖ ❖ +
The local town hall will not be an honest part of the
community which lives around it, unless it is itself surrounded
by all kinds of small community activities and
projects, generated by the people for themselves.
A lively process of community self-government depends on an
endless series of ad hoc political and service groups, functioning
freely, each with a proper chance to test its ideas before the
townspeople. The spatial component of this idea is crucial: this
process will be stymied if people cannot get started in an office on
a shoestring.
We derive the geometry of this pattern from five reguirements:
I. Small, grass roots movements, unpopular at their inception,
play a vital role in society. They provide a critical opposition to
established ideas; their presence is a direct correlate of the right
to free speech; a basic part of the self-regulation of a successful
society, which will generate counter movements whenever things
get off the track. Such movements need a place to manifest themselves,
in a way which puts their ideas directly into the public
domain. At this writing, a quick survey of the East Bay shows
about  or  bootstrap groups that are suffering for lack of
such a place: for example, Alcatraz Indians, Bang la Desh Relief,
Solidarity Films, Tenant Action Proj cct, November th Movement,
Gay Legal Defense, No on M, People's Translation
Service ....
 But as a rule these groups are small and have very little
money. To nourish this kind of activity, the community must
provide minimal space to any group of this sort, rent free, with
some limit on the duration of the lease. The space must be like a
 3
TOWNS
small storefront and have typewriters, duplicating machines, and
telephones; and access to a meeting room.
 To encourage the atmosphere of honest debate, these storefront
spaces must be near the town hall, the main crossroads of
public life. If they are scattered across the town, away from the
main town hall, they cannot seriously contend with the powers
that be.
 The space must be highly visible. It must be built in a way
which lets the group get their ideas across, to people on the street.
And it must be physically organized to undermine the natural
tendency town governments have to wall themselves in and
isolate themselves from the community once they are in power.
 Finally, to bring these groups into natural contact with
the community, the fabric of storefronts should be built to
include some of the stable shops and services that the community
needs-barbershop, cafe, laundromat.
These five requirements suggest a necklace of rather open storefront
spaces around the local town hall. This necklace of spaces is
a physical embodiment of the political process in an open society:
everyone has access to equipment, space to mount a campaign,
and the chance to get their ideas into the public arena.
Therefore:
Allow the growth of shop-size spaces around the local
town hall, and any other appropriate community building.
Front these shops on a busy path, and lease them for a minimum
rent to ad hoc community groups for political work,
trial services, research, and advocate groups. No ideological
restrictions.

 MARKET OF
MANY SHOPS**
.•. we have proposed that shops be widely decentralized and
placed in such a way that they are most accessible to the communities
which use them-WEB OF SHOPPING  ). The largest
groups of shops are arranged to form pedestrian streets or
SHOPPING STREETS    which will almost always need a market
to survive. This pattern describes the form and economic character
of markets.
It is natural and convenient to want a market where all
the different foods and household goods you need can be
bought under a single roof. But when the market has a
single management, like a supermarket, the foods are
bland, and there is no joy in going there.
It is true that the large supermarkets do have a great variety
of foods. But this "variety" is still centrally purchased, centrally
warehoused, and still has the staleness of mass merchandise. In
addition, there is no human contact left, only rows of shelves and
then a harried encounter with the check-out man who takes your
money.
The only way to get the human contact back, and the variety
of food, and all the love and care and wisdom about individual
foods which shopkeepers who know what they are selling can
bring to it, is to create those markets once again in which individual
owners sell different goods, from tiny stalls, under a
common roof.
As it stands, supermarkets are likely to get bigger and bigger,
to conglomerate with other industries, and to go to all lengths to
dehumanize the experience of the marketplace. Horn and
Hardart, for example, have been contemplating this scheme:
... the customer either drives her car or walks onto a moving
ramp, is conveyed decorously through the whole store, selects her
groceries by viewing samples displayed in lighted wall panels  or
unlocking the cases with a special key or her credit card), and chooses
her meat and produce via closed circuit TV. She then drives around
to a separate warehouse area to collect her order, paid for by a uni-

TOWNS
versa! credit card system .... Most of the people would be invisible .
. . . Jennifer Cross, The Supermarket Trap, New York: Berkeley
Medallion,   ).
Now contrast this with the following description of an oldfashioned
market place in San Francisco:
If you visit the Market regularly you come to have favorite stalls,
like the one with the pippin and Hauer apples from Watsonville.
The farmer looks at each apple as he chooses it and places it in the
bag, reminding you to keep them in a cool place so they will remain
crisp and sweet. If you display interest, he tells you with pride about
the orchard they come from and how they were grown and cared
for, his blue eyes meeting yours. His English is spoken with a slight
Italian accent so you wonder about the clear blue eyes, light brown
hair and long-boned body until he tells you about the part of northern
Italy where he was born.
There is a handsome black man offering small mountains of melons
where the stalls end. Tell him you are not enough of an expert to
choose one you would like to have perfect for the day after tomorrow,
and he will not only pick one out that he assures you will be
just right as it turns out to be), but gives you a lesson in choosing
your next melon, whether cranshaw, honeydew or watermelon,
wherever you may happen to buy it. He cares that you will always
get a good one and enjoy it. "The Farmers Go to Market," California
Living, San Francisco Chronicle Sunday Magazine, February
6, 72.)
There is no doubt that this is far more human and enlivening
than the supermarket conveyor belt. The critical question lies
with the economics of the operation. Is there a reasonable
economic basis for a marketplace of many shops/ Or are markets
ruled OU t by the efficiencies of the supermarket r
There do not seem to be any economic obstacles more serious
than those which accompany the start of any business. The major
problem is one of coordination-coordination of individual shops
to form one coherent market and coordination of many similar
shops, from several markets, to make bulk purchase arrangements.
If individual shops are well located, they can operate competitively,
at profit margins of up to  per cent of sales "Expenses in
Retail Business," National Cash Register, Dayton, Ohio, p. r ).
According to National Cash Register figures, this profit margin
stays the same, regardless of size, for all convenience food stores.
The small stores are often undercut by supermarkets because they
are located by themselves, and therefore cannot off er shoppers
 MARKET OF MANY SHOPS
the same variety at one stop, as the supermarket. However, if
many of these small shops are clustered and centrally located, and
together they offer a variety comparable to the supermarket, then
they can compete effectively with the chain supermarkets.
The one efficiency that chain stores do maintain is the efficiency
of bulk purchase. But even this can be offset if groups of similar
shops, all over the town, coordinate their needs and set up
bulk purchase arrangements. For example, in the Bay Area there
are a number of flower vendors running their business from small
carts on the street. Although each vendor manages his own affairs
independently, all the vendors go in together to buy their
flowers. They gain enormously by purchasing their flowers in
bulk and undersell the established florists three to one.
Of course, it is difficult for a market of many shops to get
started-it is hard to find a place and hard to finance it. We
propose a very rough and simple structure in the beginning, that
can be filled in and improved over time. The market in the
photo, in Lima, Peru, began with nothing more than freestanding
columns and aisles. The shops-most of them no more
than six feet by nine-were built up gradually between the
columns.

Therefore:

are autonomous and specialized  cheese, meat, grain, fruit,

which provides no more than a roof, columns which
define aisles, and basic services. Within this structure allow
the different shops to create their own environment,
according to their individual taste and needs.

 HEALTH CENTER*
... the explicit recognit10n of the life cycle as the basis for
every individual life will do a great deal to help people's health
in the community-LIFE CYCLE ); this pattern describes the
more specific institutions which. help people to care for themselves
and their health.
More than  per cent of the people walking about in an
ordinary neighborhood are unhealthy, judged by simple
biological criteria. This ill health cannot be cured by hospitals
or medicine.
Hospitals put the emphasis on sickness. They are enormously
expensive; they are inconvenient because they are too centralized;
and they tend to create sickness, rather than cure it, becaus
doctors get paid when people are sick.
By contrast, in traditional Chinese medicine, people pay the
doctor only when they are healthy; when they are sick, he is
obliged to treat them, without payment. The doctors have incentives
to keep people well.
A system of health care which is actually capable of keeping
people healthy, in both mind and body, must put its emphasis on
health, not sickness. It must therefore be physically decentralized
so that it is as close as possible to people's everyday activities. And
it must be able to encourage people in daily practices that lead
to health. The core of the solution, as far as we can see, must be
a system of small, widely distributed, health centers, which
encourage physical activities-swimming, dancing, sports, and
fresh air-and provide medical treatment only as an incidental
side of these activities.
There is converging evidence and speculation in the health
 HEALTH CENTER
care literature that health centers with these characteristics, organized
according to the philosophy of health maintenance, are
critical. See, for example: William H. Glazier, "The Task of
Medicine," Scientific American, Vol. 28, No. , April 73,
pp. I -17; and Milton Roemer, "Nationalized Medicine for
America," Transaction, September I  I, p.  I.)
We know of several attempts to develop health care programs
which are in line with this proposal. In most of the cases, though,
the programs fall short in their hopes because, despite their good
intentions, they still tend to cater to the sick, they do not work
to maintain health. Take, for example, the so-called "community
mental health centers" encouraged by the United States National
Institute of Mental Health during the late 6o's. On paper,
these centers are intended to encourage health, not cure sickness.
In practice it is a very different story. We visited one of the
most advanced, in San Anselmo, California. The patients sit
around all day long; their eyes are glazed; they are ha! f-enth usiastically
doing "clay therapy" or "paint therapy." One patient
came up to us and said, "Doctor," his eyes shining with happiness,
"this is a wonderful mental health center; it is the very best one
I have ever been in." In short, the patients are kept as patients;
they understand themselves to be patients; in certain cases they
even revel in their role as patients. They have no useful occupation,
no work, nothing useful they can show at the end of a day,
nothing to be proud of. The center, for all its intentions to be
human, in fact reinforces the patients' idea of their own sickness
and encourages the behavior of sickness, even while it is preaching
and advocating health.
The same is true for the Kaiser-Permanente program in
California. The Kaiser hospitals have been hailed in a recent
article as "ones which shift the emphasis away from treatment
of illness and toward the maintenance of health William H.
Glazier, "The Task of Medicine"). Members of Kaiser are entitled
to a multi-phasic examination yearly, intended to give
every member a complete picture of the state of his health. But
the conception of health which is created by this multi-phasic
program is still "freedom from sickness." It is essentially negative.
There is no effort made toward the positive creation and maintenance
of actual, blooming, health. And besides, the Kaiser Center
 3
TOWNS
is still nothing but a giant hospital. People are treated as numbers;
the center is so large and concentrated that the doctors
cannot possibly see their patients as people in their natural communities.
They see them as patients.
The only health center we know which actually devoted itself
to health instead of sickness was the famous Peckham Health
Center in England. The Peckham Center was a club, run by
two doctors, focused on a swimming pool, a dance floor, and a
cafe. In addition, there were doctors' offices, and it was understood
that families-never individuals-would receive periodic
check-ups as part of their activities around the swimming and
dancing. Under these conditions, people used the center regularly,
during the day and at night. The question of their health
became fused with the ordinary life of the community, and this
set the stage for a most extraordinary kind of health care.
For example, it seems that many of the mothers in workingclass
pre-war England, were ashamed of their own bodies. This
shame reached such proportions that they were ashamed of
suckling and holding their own babies, and in many cases they
actually did not want their babies as a result. The Peckham
Center was able to dismantle this syndrome entirely by its emphasis
on health. The program of swimming and dancing, coupled
with the family checkups, allowed women to become proud of
their own bodies; they no longer felt afraid of their own newborn
babies, no longer felt shame about their bodies; the babies
felt wanted; and the incidence of emotional disturbance and
childhood psychosis among the children in later years was
drastically reduced within the Peckham population, starting
exactly from the year when the health center began its operation.
This kind of profound biological connection between physical
health, family life, and emotional welfare was truly the beginning
of a new era in human biology. It is described, beautifully, and
at length, by two doctors from Peckham Center Innes Pearse
and Lucy Crocker, The Peckham Experi-ment, A Study in the
Living Structure of Society, New Haven: Yale University Press,
I 46). Only when biological ideas of th is depth and power are
taken seriously will it be possible to have real health centers,
instead of sickness centers.

 HEALTH CENTER
Therefore:
Gradually develop a network of small health centers,
perhaps one per community of 000, across the city; each
equipped to treat everyday disease-both mental and physical,
in children and adults-but organized essentially around
a functional emphasis on those recreational and educational
activities which help keep people in good health, like swimming
and dancing.

force these facilities to form a continuous "health park"-knit
them together loosely with other parts of the town-HOUSING IN

the most important subsidiary pattern for helping people to

HOUSING IN BETWEEN**
... most housing is in residential neighborhoods, and in the
clusters within neighborhoods-IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD
(14), HOUSE CLUSTER ); and according to our patterns these
housing areas need to be separated by boundaries which contain
public land and work communities-SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY
( I ), NEIGHBORHOOD BOUNDARY  I ), WORK COMMUNITY   I),
But even these work communities, and boundaries, and shopping
streets, must contain houses which have people living in them.
❖ ❖ +
Wherever there is a sharp separation between residential
and nonresidential parts of town, the nonresidential areas
will quickly turn to slums.
The personal rhythms of maintenance and repair are central
to the well bejng of any part of a community, because it is only
these rhythms which keep up a steady sequence of adaptations and
corrections in the organization of the whole. Slums happen when
these rhythms break down.
Now in a town, the processes of maintenance and repair hinge
on the fact of user ownership. In other words, the places where
people are user-owners are kept up nicely; the places where they
are not, tend to run down. When people have their own homes
among shops, workplaces, schools, services, the university, these
places are enhanced by the vitality that is natural to their homes.
They extend themselves to make it personal and comfortable. A
person will put more of himself into his home than into any of
the other places where he spends his time. And it is unlikely that
a person can put this kind of feeling into two places, two parts of
his life. We conclude that many parts of the environment have
the arid quality of not being cared for personally, for the simple
reason that indeed nobody lives there.
It is only where houses are mixed in between the other functions,
in twos and threes, in rows and tiny clusters, that the personal
quality of the households and house-building activities gives
energy to the workshops and offices and services.

TOWNS
Therefore:
Build houses into the fabric of shops, small industry,
schools, public services, universities-all those parts of cities
which draw people in during the day, but which tend to
be "nonresidential." The houses may be in rows or "hills"
with shops beneath, or they may be free-standing, so long
as they mix with the other functions, and make the entire
area "lived-in."

the layout of the local roads.
Nobody wants fast through traffic going by their homes.
Through traffic is fast, noisy, and dangerous. At the same time
cars are important, and cannot be excluded altogether from the
areas where people live. Local roads must provide access to houses
but prevent traffic from coming through.
This problem can only be solved if all roads which have houses
on them are laid out to be "loops." We define a looped road as
any road in a road network so placed that no path along other
roads in the road network can be shortened by travel along the
"loop."
The loops themselves must be designed to discourage high
volumes or high speeds: this depends on the total number of
houses served by the loop, the road surface, the road width, and
the number of curves and corners. Our observations suggest that a
loop can be made safe so long as it serves less than  cars. At
one and one-half cars per house, such a loop serves  houses; at
one car per house,  houses; at one-half car per house, 00
houses.
Here is an example of an entire system of looped local roads
designed for a community of I  houses in Peru.

Dead-end streets are also loops, according to the definition.
However, cul-de-sacs are very bad from a social standpointthey
force interaction and they feel claustrophobic, because there

sure that the pedestrian path is a through path, leading into the

Lay out the road system so that any two roads which
meet at grade, meet in three-way T junctions as near

At busy junctions, where pedestrian paths converge, make a
special raised crossing for pedestrians, something more than the
usual crosswalk-ROAD CROSSING(  ).

 I GREEN STREETS**

... this pattern helps to give the character of local roads. Even
though it only defines the surface of the road, and the position
of parking, the gradual emergence of this pattern in an area, can
be used, piecemeal, to create LOOPED LOCAL ROADS ), T JUNCTIONS
(50), and COMMON LAND ). This pattern was inspired
by a beautiful road in the north of Denmark, built by AnneMarie
Rubin, and illustrated here.
There is too much hot hard asphalt in the world. A local
road, which only gives access to buildings, needs a few
stones for the wheels of the cars; nothing more. Most of it
can still be green.
In a typical low density American suburb, more than  per
cent of the land is covered with concrete or asphalt paving. In
some areas, like downtown Los Angeles, it is more than  per
cent.
This concrete and asphalt have a terrible elf ect on the local
environment. They destroy the microclimate; they do nothing
useful with the solar energy that falls on them; they are unpleasant
to walk on; there is nowhere to sit; nowhere for children
to play; the natural drainage of the ground is devastated; animals
and plants can hardly survive.
The fact is that asphalt and concrete are only suitable for use
on high speed roads. They are unsuitable, and quite unnecessary,
on local roads, where a few cars are moving in and out. When
local roads are paved, wide and smooth, like major roads, drivers
are encouraged to travel past our houses at   or  miles per
hom. What is needed, instead, on local roads is a grassy surface
that is adapted to the primary uses of the common land between
the buildings, with just enough hard paving to cope with the few
cars that do go on it.
The best solution is a field of grass, with paving stones set into
it. This arrangement provides for animals and children and makes
the street a focal point for the neighborhood. On hot summer
TOWNS
days the air over the grass surface is IO to  degrees cooler than
the air over an asphalt road. And the cars are woven into this
scheme, but they do not dominate it.
Paving stones.
Of course, such a scheme raises immediately the question of
parking. How shall it be organized' It is possible to arrange for
parking on green streets, so long as it is parking for residents and
their guests, only. When overflow parking from shopping streets
and work communities sprawls onto streets that were intended to
be quiet neighborhoods, the character of the neighborhood is
drastically altered. The residents generally resent this situation.
Often it means they cannot park in front of their own homes.
The neighborhood becomes a parking lot for strangers who care
nothing about it, who simply store their cars there.
The green street will only work if it is based on the principle
that the street need not, and should not, provide for more parking
than its people need. Parking for visitors can be in small
parking lots at the ends of the street; parking for people in the
individual houses and workshops can either be in the same parking
lots or in the driveways of the buildings.
This does not imply that commercial activities, shops, and
businesses should be excluded from residential areas. In fact, as
we have said in SCATTERED WORK  ), it is extremely important
to build such functions into neighborhoods. The point is, however,
that businesses cannot assume when they move into a neighborhood
that they have the right to a huge amount of free parking.
They must pay for their parking; and they must pay for it
in a way which is consistent with the environmental needs of the
neighborhood.

5I GREEN STREETS
Therefore:
On local roads, closed to through traffic, plant grass all
over the road and set occasional paving stones into the grass
to form a surface for the wheels of those cars that need
access to the street. Make no distinction between street and
sidewalk. Where houses open off the street, put in more
paving stones or gravel to let cars turn onto their own land.
When a road is a green street, it is so pleasant that it naturally
tends to attract activity to it. In this Clse, the paths and the
green street are one-COMMON LAND  ). However, even when
the street is green, it may be pleasant to put in occasional very
small lanes, a few feet wide, at right angles to the green streets,
according to NETWORK OF PATHS AND CARS   ). In order to
preserve the greenness of the street, it will be essential, too, to
keep parked cars in driveways on the individual lots, or in tiny
parking lots, at the ends of the street, reserved for the house owners
and their visitors-SMALL PARKING LOTS  I 03). Fruit trees
and flowers will make the street more beautiful-FRUIT TREES
(170), RAISED FLOWERS )-and the paving stones which
form the beds for cars to drive on, can themselves be laid with
cracks between them and with grass and moss and flowers in the
cracks between the stones-PAVING WITH CRACKS BETWEEN THE

AND CARS**
... roads may be governed by PARALLEL ROADS   ), LOOPED
LOCAL ROADS  ), GREEN STREETS    ; major paths by ACTIVITY
NODES 0), PROMENADE 1), and PATHS AND GOALS 0).
This pattern governs the interaction between the two.
Cars are dangerous to pedestrians; yet activities occur just
where cars and pedestrians meet.
It is common planning practice to separate pedestrians and cars.
This makes pedestrian areas more human and safer. However, this
practice fails to take account of the fact that cars and pedestrians
also need each other: and that, in fact, a great deal of urban life
occurs at just the point where these two systems meet. Many of
the greatest places in cities, Piccadilly Circus, Times Square,
the Champs Elysees, are alive because they are at places where
pedestrians and vehicles meet. New towns like Cumbernauld, in
Scotland, where there is total separation between the two, seldom
have the same sort of liveliness.
The same thing is true at the local residental scale. A great
deal of everyday social life occurs where cars and pedestrians
meet. In Lima, for example, the car is used as an extension of
the house: men, especially, often sit in parked cars, near their
houses, drinking beer and talking. And in one way or another,
something like this happens everywhere. Conversation and discussion
grow naturally around the lots where people wash their
cars. Vendors set themselves up where cars and pedestrians meet;
they need all the traffic they can get. Children play in parking
Children like cars.

TOWNS
lots-perhaps because they sense that this is the main point of
arrival and departure; and of course because they like the cars.
Yet, at the same time, it is essential to keep pedestrians separate
from vehicles: to protect children and old people; to preserve the
tranquility of pedestrian life.
To resolve the conflict, it is necessary to find an arrangement
of pedestrian paths and roads, so that the two are separate, but
meet frequently, with the points where they meet recognized as
focal points. In general, this requires two orthogonal networks, one
for roads, one for paths, each connected and continuous, crossing
at frequent intervals our observations suggest that most points on
the path network should be within I  feet of the nearest road),
meeting, when they meet, at right angles.
Two orthogonal networks.
In practice, there are several possible ways of forming this relationship
between the roads and paths.
It can be done within the system of fast one-way roads about
 feet apart described in PARALLEL ROADS  ). Between the
roads there are pedestrian paths running at right angles to the
roads, with buildings opening off the pedestrian paths. Where the

for kiosks and shops.
It can be applied to an existing neighborhood-as it is in the
following sequence of plans drawn by the People's Architects,
Berkeley, California. This shows a beautiful and simple way of
creating a path network in an existing grid of streets, by closing
off alternate streets, in each direction. As the drawings show, it
can be done gradually.

Different again, is our project for housing in Lima. Here the
two orthogonal systems are laid out as follows:

T /,e t'lvO together.
In all these cases, we see a global pattern, in which roads and
paths are created more or less at the same time-and therefore
brought into the proper relationship. However, it is essential to
recognize that in most practical applications of this pattern, it is
 3
TOWNS
not necessary to locate the roads and paths together. Most
typically of all, there is an existing road system: and the paths
can be put in one by one, piecemeal, at right angles to the existing
roads. Slowly, very slowly, a coherent path network will be
created by the accumulation of these piecemeal acts.
Finally, note that this kind of separation of cars from pedestrians
is only appropriate where traffic densities are medium or
medium high. At low densities for instance, a cul-de-sac gravel
road serving half-a-dozen houses), the paths and roads can obviously
be combined. There is no reason even to have sidewalksGREEN
STREETS   I). At very high densities, like the Champs
Elysees, or Piccadilly Circus, a great deal of the excitement is
actually created by the fact that pedestrian paths are running
along the roads. In these cases the problem is best solved by
extra wide sidewalks-RAISED WALKS   )-which actually contain
the resolution of the conflict in their width. The edge away
from the road is safe-the edge near the road is the place where
the activities happen.
Therefore:
Except where traffic densities are very high or very low,
lay out pedestrian paths at right angles to roads, not along
them, so that the paths gradually begin to form a second
network, distinct from the road system, and orthogonal to
it. This can be done quite gradually-even if you put in
one path at a time, but always put them in the middle of
the "block," so that they run across the roads.

 NETWORK OF PATHS AND CARS
Where paths have to run along major roads-as they do occasionally-
build them I  inches higher than the road, on one

then, occasional narrow paths at right angles to the green streets

Finally, treat the important street crossings as crosswalks, raised
to the level of the pedestrian path-so cars have to slow down
as they go over them-ROAD CROSSING( 4 ....

  MAIN GATEWAYS**
... at vanous levels in the structure of the town, there are
identifiable units. There are neighborhoods-IDENTIFIABLE
NEIGHBORHOOD  ), clusters-HOUSE CLUSTER ), communities
of work-WORK COMMUNITY   I ; and there are many
smaller building complexes ringed around some realms of circulation-
BUILDING COMPLEX 5), CIRCULATION REALMS 8). All
of them get their identity most clearly from the fact that you pass
through a definite gateway to enter them-it is this gateway
acting as a threshold which creates the unit.
Any part of a town-large or small-which is to be identified
by its inhabitants as a precinct of some kind, will
be reinforced, helped in its distinctness, marked, and made
more vivid, if the paths which enter it are marked by
gateways where they cross the boundary.
Many parts of a town have boundaries drawn around them.
These boundaries are usually in people's minds. They mark the
end of one kind of activity, one kind of place, and the beginning
of another. In many cases, the activities themselves are made more
sharp, more vivid, more alive, if the boundary which exists in
people's minds is also present physically in the world.
A botmdary around an important precinct, whether a neighborhood,
a building complex, or some other area, is most critical
at those points where paths cross the boundary. If the point
where the path crosses the boundary is invisible, then to all intents
and purposes the boundary is not there. It will be there, it
will be felt, only if the crossing is marked. And essentially, the
crossing of a boundary by a path can only be marked by a gateway.
That is why all forms of gateway play such an important role
in the environment.
A gateway can have many forms: a literal gate, a bridge, a passage
between narrowly separated buildings, an avenue of trees, a
gateway through a building. All of these have the same function:
they mark the point where a path crosses a boundary and help

TOWNS
maintain the boundary. All of them are "things"-not merely
holes or gaps, but solid entities.
Gateways mark the point of transition.
In every case, the crucial feeling which this solid thing must
create is the feeling of transition.
Therefore:
Mark every boundary in the city which has important
human meaning-the boundary of a building cluster, a
neighborhood, a precinct-by great gateways where the
major entering paths cross the boundary.

feeling of transition for the person passing through the gateway,
by allowing change of light, or surface, view, crossing water, a
change of level-ENTRANCE TRANSITION  12). In every case,
treat the main gateway as the starting point of the pedestrian circulation
inside the precinct-CIRCULATION REALMS  8 ....

 ROAD CROSSING

... under the impetus of PARALLEL ROADS  and NETWORK
OF PATHS AND CARS 2), paths will gradually grow at right angles
to major roads-not along them as they do now. This is an entirely
new kind of situation, and requires an entirely new physical
treatment to make it work.

Where paths cross roads, the cars have power to frighten
and subdue the people walking, even when the people
walking have the legal right-of-way.
This will happen whenever the path and the road are at the
same level. No amount of painted white lines, crosswalks, traffic
lights, button operated signals, ever quite manage to change the
fact that a car weighs a ton or more, and will run over any
pedestrian, unless the driver brakes. Most often the driver does
brake. But everyone knows of enough occasions when brakes have
failed, or drivers gone to sleep, to be perpetually wary and afraid.
The people who cross a road will only feel comfortable and safe
if the road crossing is a physical obstruction, which physically
guarantees that the cars must slow down and give way to pedestrians.
In many places it is recognized by law that pedestrians
have the right-of-way over automobiles. Yet at the crucial points
where paths cross roads, the physical arrangement gives priority
to cars. The road is continuous, smooth, and fast, interrupting the
pedestrian walkway at the junctions. This continuous road surface
actually implies that the car has the right-of-way.
What should crossings be like to accommodate the needs of the
pedestrians?
' The fact that pedestrians feel less vulnerable to cars when they
are about I  inches above them, is discussed in the next pattern
RAISED WALK   ). The same principle applies, even more
powerfully, where pedestrians have to cross a road. The pedestrians
who cross must be extremely visible from the road. Cars
should also be forced to slow down when they approach the crossing.
If the pedestrian way crosses  to I  inches above the roadTOWNS
way, and the roadway slopes up to it, this satisfies both requirements.
A slope of I in , or less, is safe for cars and solid enough
to slow them down. To make the crossing even easier to see from
a distance and to give weight to the pedestrian's right to be there,
the pedestrian path could be marked by a canopy at the edge of
the road-CANVAS ROOFS  4).
Almost a road crossing but no bump.
We know that this pattern is rather extraordinary. For this
reason, we consider it quite essential that readers do not try to
use it on every road, for formalistic reasons, but only on those
roads where i, is badly needed. We therefore comnlete the problem
statement by Je/ining a simple experiment which you can do
to decide whether or not a given crossing needs this treatment.
Go to the road in question several times, at different times of
day. Each time you go, count the number of seconds you have to
wait before you can cross the road. If the average of these waiting
times is more than two seconds, then we recommend you use
the pattern. On the basis of Buchanan's statement that roads become
threatening to pedestrians when the volume of traffic on
them creates an average delay of two seconds or more, for people
trying to cross on foot. See the extensive discussion, Colin
Buchanan et al., Traffic in Towns, HMSO, London, 63, pp.
203- . If you cannot do this experiment, or the road is not
yet built, you may be able to guess, by using the chart below. It
shows which combinations of volume and width will typically
create more than a two-second average delay.

Roads that fall in t!te shaded region require special

One final note. This pattern may be impossible to implement,
in places where traffic engineers are still in control. Nevertheless
the functional issue is vital, and must not be ignored. A big wide
road, with several bnes of heavy traffic can form an almost impenetrable
barrier. In this case, you can solve the problem, at least
partially, by creating islands-certainly one in the middle, and perhaps
extra islands, between adjacent lanes. This has a huge effect
on a person's capacity to cross the road, for a very simple reason.
If you are trying to cross a wide road, you have to wait for a gap
to occnr simultaneously in each of the lanes. It is the waiting for
this coincidence of gaps that creates the problem. But if you can
hop, from island to island, each time a gap occurs in any one lane,
one lane at a time, you can get across in no time at all-because
the gaps which occur in individual lanes are many many times
more frequent, than the big gaps in all lanes at the same time.
So, if you can't raise the crossing, at least use islands, like stepping
stones.
Therefore:
At any point where a pedestrian path crosses a road that
has enough traffic to create more than a two second delay
to people crossing, make a "knuckle" at the crossing:
TOWNS
narrow the road to the width of the through lanes only;
continue the pedestrian path through the crossing about a
foot above the roadway; put in islands between lanes; slope
the road up toward the crossing  in  maximum); mark
the path with a canopy or shelter to make it visible.

On one side or the other of the road make the pedestrian path

a bus stop-SMALL PUDLJC SQUARES(  I), BUS STOP  2) FOOD
STANDS( ); provide one or two bays for standing space for buses
and cars-SMALL PARKING LOTS  I 03), and when a path must run
from the road crossing along the side of the road, keep it to one
side only, make it as wide as possible, and raised above the roadway-
RAISED WALK 5). Perhaps build the canopy as a trellis
or canvas roof-TRELLISED WALK 4), CANVAS ROOFS
( 4 ....
  RAISED WALK*
... this pattern helps complete the NETWORK OF PATHS AND
CARS 2 and ROADC ROSSINGS( ). It is true that in most cases,
pedestrian paths which follow the path network will be running
across roads, not next to them. But still, from time to time, especially
along major PARALLEL ROADS ), between one road
crossing and the next, there is a need for paths along the road.
This pattern gives these special paths their character.
Where fast moving cars and pedestrians meet in cities,
the cars overwhelm the pedestrians. The car is king, and
people are made to feel small.
This cannot be solved by keeping pedestrians separate from
cars; it is in their nature that they have to meet, at least occasionally-
NETWORK oF PATHS AND CARS   ). What can be done
at those points where cars and pedestrians do meetl
On an ordinary street, cars make pedestrians feel small and
vt1lnerable because the sidewalks are too narrow and too low.
When the sidewalk is too narrow, yon feel yon are goi.ng to fall
off, or get pushed off-and there is always a chance that you will
step off just in front of a passing car. When the sidewalk is too
low, you feel that cars can easily mount the sidewalk, if they go
out of control, and crush you. It is clear, then, that pedestrians
will feel comfortable, powerful, safe, and free in their movements
when the walks they walk on are both wide enough to keep the
Traditional raised walk in Pic!tucalis, Mexico.

 RAISED WALK
people well away from the cars, and high enough to make it
quite impossible for any car to drive up on them by accident.
We first consider the width. What is the appropriate width
for a raised walk? The famous example, of course, is the Champs
Elysees, where the sidewalk is more than  feet wide, and
very comfortable. In our own experience, a walk of half this
width, along a typical shopping street with traffic, is still comfortable;
but I  feet or less, and a pedestrian begins to feel
cramped and threatened by cars. A conventional sidewalk is often
no more than  feet wide; and people really feel the presence of
the cars. How can we afford the extra width which people need
in order to be comfortable? One way: instead of putting sidewalks
along both sides of a road, we can put a double width raised walk
along one side of the road only, with road crossings at intervals
of  to  feet. This means, of course, that there can only be
shops along one side of the road.
What is the right height for a raised walk? Our experiments
suggest that pedestrians begin to feel secure when they are about
I  inches above the cars. There are a number of possible reasons
for this finding.
One possible reason. When the car is down low and the pedestrian
world physically higher, pedestrians feel, symbolically,
that they are more important than the cars and therefore feel
secure.
Another possible reason. It may be that the car overwhelms the
pedestrian because of a constant, unspoken possibility that a runaway
car might at any moment mount the curb and run him down.
A car can climb an ordinary six inch curb easily. For the pedestrian
to feel certain that a car could not climb the curb, the
curb height would have to be greater than the radius of a car tire
( to  inches).
Another possible reason. Most people's eye level is between
 I and  inches. A typical car has an overall height of   inches.
Although tall people can see over cars, even for them, the cars
fill the landscape since a standing person's normal line of sight
is IO degrees below the horizontal Henry Dreyfus, The Measure
of Man, New York, 58, sheet F). To put a car  feet away
completely below a pedestrian's line of sight, it would have to be
on a road some I  to  o inches below the pedestrian.
TOWNS
Keep the cars be tow a person's line of sight.
Therefore:
We conclude that any pedestrian path along a road carrying
fast-moving cars should be about  inches above the
road, with a low wall or railing, or balustrade along the
edge, to mark the edge. Put the raised walk on only one
side of the road-make it as wide as possible.

 BIKE PATHS AND RACKS*
... within a LOCAL TRANSPORT AREA II there is a heavy
concentration of small vehicles like bikes, electric carts, perh.-ps
even horses, which need a system of bike paths. The bike paths
will play a very large role in helping to create the local transport
areas, and may also help to modify LOOPED LOCAL ROADS  and
NETWORK OF PATHS AND CARS 2).

Bikes are cheap, healthy, and good for the environment;
but the environment is not designed for them. Bikes on
roads are threatened by cars; bikes on paths threaten pedestrians.
In making the environment safe for bikes, the following problems
must be solved:
I. Bikes are threatened where they meet or cross heavy automobile
traffic.
 They are also threatened by parked cars. Parked cars make
it difficult for the bike rider to see other people, and they make it
difficult for other people to see him. In addition, since the bike
rider usually has to ride close to parked cars, he is always in danger
of someone opening a car door in front of him.
 Bikes endanger pedestrians along pedestrian paths; yet people
often tend to ride bikes along pedestrian paths, not roads,
because they are the shortest routes.
 Where bikes are in heavy use, for instance around schools
and universities, they can lay a pedestrian precinct to waste in
their own way, just as cars can.
An obvious solution to these problems is to create a completely
independent system of bike paths. However, it is doubtful that
this is a viable or desirable solution. The study "Students on
Wheels" Jany, Putney, and Ritter; Department of Landscape
Architecture, University of Oregon, Eugene, Oregon, I  )
shows that bike riders and nonbike riders want a mixed system, so
long as it is reasonably safe.
We also think that it is essential for bike paths to run in streets
 BIKE PATHS AND RACKS
and along pedestrian paths: if bikes are forced onto a separate
system, it will almost certainly be violated by people taking shortcuts
across the other networks. And laws which would keep bikes
completely off the road and path systems would be discouraging
to the already hasseled bike riders. Wherever possible, then, bike
paths should coincide with roads and major pedestrian paths.
Where bike paths coincide with major roads, they must be
separated from the roadway. It helps put the bike rider in a safer
position with respect to the cars if the bike path is raised a few
inches from the road; or separated by a row of trees.
Where bike paths run alongside local roads, parking should be
removed from that side of the road; the bike surface may simply
be part of the road and level with it. An article by Bascome in
the Oregon Daily Emerald October 71 suggested that bike
lanes along streets should always be on the sunny side of the
street.
Where bike paths coincide with major pedestrian paths, they
should be separate from the paths, perhaps a few inches below
them. Here, the change in level gives the pedestrian a sense of
safety from the bikes.
Quiet paths and certain pedestrian precincts should be completely
protected from bikes for the same reasons that they need
to be protected from cars. This can be handled by making the
bike path system bypass these places, or by enclosing these places
with steps or low walls which force bike riders to dismount and
walk their bikes.
Therefore:
Build a system of paths designated as bike paths, with
the following properties: the bike paths are marked clearly
with a special, easily recognizable surface for example, a
red asphalt surface). As far as possible they run along local
roads, or major pedestrian paths. Where a bike path runs
along a local road, its surface may be level with the road
-if possible, on the sunny side; where a bike path runs
along a pedestrian path, keep it separate from that path and
a few inches below it. Bring the system of bike paths to
TOWNS
within mo feet of every building, and give every building a
bike rack near its main entrance.

 CHILDREN IN
THE CITY

... roads, bike paths, and main pedestrian paths are given their
position by PARALLEL ROADS ), PROMENADE 1), LOOPED
LOCAL ROADS ), GREEN STREETS 1), NETWORK OF PATHS
AND CARS 2), BIKE PATHS AND RACKS ). Some of them are
safe for children, others are less safe. Now, finally, to complete the
paths and roads, it is essential to define at least one place, right
in the very heart of cities, where children can be completely free
and safe. If handled properly, this pattern can play a great role
in helping to create the NETWORK OF LEARNING  I ).
If children are not able to explore the whole of the adult
world round about them, they cannot become adults. But
modern cities are so dangerous that children cannot be allowed
to explore them freely.
The need for children to have access to the world of adults is
so obvious that it goes with out saying. The adults transmit their
ethos and their w:iy of life to children through their actions, not
through statements. Children learn by doing and by copying.
If the child's education is limited to school and home, and all the
vast undertakings of a modern city are mysterious and inaccessible,
it is impossible for the child to find out what it really means to be
an adult and impossible, certainly, for him to copy it by doing.
This separation between the child's world and the adult world
is unknown among animals and unknown in traditional societies.
In simple villages, children spend their days side by side with
farmers in the fields, side by side with people who are building
houses, side by side, in fact, with all the daily actions of the men
and women round about them: making pottery, counting money,
curing the sick, praying to God, grinding corn, arguing about the
future of the village.
But in the city, l i fc is so enormous and so dangerous, that
children can't be left alone to roam around. There is constant
danger from fast-moving cars and trucks, and dangerous machinery.
There is a small but ominous danger of kidnap, or rape,

 CHILDREN IN THE CITY
or assault. And, for the smallest children, there is the simple danger
of getting lost. A small child just doesn't know enough to
find his way around a city.
The problem seems nearly insoluble. But we believe it can be
at least partly solved by enlarging those parts of cities where
small children can be left to roam, alone, and by trying to make
sure that these protected children's belts are so widespread and so
far-reaching that they touch the full variety of adult activities
and ways of life.
We imagine a carefully developed childrens' bicycle path,
within the larger network of bike paths. The path goes past and
through interesting parts of the city; and it is relatively safe. It
is part of the overall system and therefore used by everyone. It
is not a special children's "ride"-which would immediately be
shunned by the adventurous young-but it does have a special
name, and perhaps it is specially colored.
The path is always a bike path; it never runs beside cars.
Where it crosses traffic there arc lights or bridges. There are
many homes and shops along the path-adults are nearby, especially
the old enjoy spending an hour a day sitting along this
path, themselves riding along the loop, watching the kids out of
the corner of one eye.
And most important, the great beauty of this path is that it
passes along and even through those functions and parts of a town
which are normally out of reach: the place where newspapers are
printed, the place where milk arrives from the countryside and
is bottled, the pier, the garage where people make doors and

 CARNIVAL
... once in a while, in a subculture which is particularly open
to it, a promenade may break into a wilder rhythm-PROMENADE
(  I), NIGHT LIFE    )-and perhaps every promenade may
have a touch of this.
Just as an individual person dreams fantastic happenings
to release the inner forces which cannot be encompassed by
ordinary events, so too a city needs its dreams.
Under normal circumstances, in today's world the entertainments
which are available are either healthy and harmless-going
to the movies, watching TV, cycling, playing tennis, taking
helicopter rides, going for walks, watching football-or downright
sick and socially destructive-shooting heroin, driving recklessly,
group violence.
But man has a great need for mad, subconscious processes to
come into play, without unleashing them to such an extent that
they become socially destructive. There is, in short, a need for
socially sanctioned activities which are the social, outward equivalents
of dreaming.
In primitive societies this kind of process was provided by the
rites, witch doctors, shamans. In Western civilization during the
last three or four hundred years, the closest available source of
this outward acknowledgment of underground life has been the
circus, fairs, and carnivals. In the middle ages, the market place
itself had a good deal of this kind of atmosphere.
Today, on the whole, this kind of experience is gone. The
circuses and the carnivals are drying up. But the need persists. In
the Bay Area, the annual Renaissance Fair goes a little way to
meet the need-but it is much too bland. We imagine something
more along the following lines: street theater, clowns, mad games
in the streets and squares and houses; during certain weeks, people
may live in the carnival; simple food and shelter are free;
day and night people mixing; actors who mingle with the crowd
and involve you, willy nilly, in processes whose end cannot be

foreseen; fighting-two men with bags on a slippery log, in

Remember the hunchbacked dwarf in Ship of Fools, the only
reasonable person on the ship, who says "Everyone has a problem;
but I have the good fortune to wear mine on my back, where
everyone can see it."
Therefore:
Set aside some part of the town as a carnival-mad sideshows,
tournaments, acts, displays, competitions, dancing,
music, street theater, clowns, transvestites, freak events,
which allow people to reveal their madness; weave a wide
pedestrian street through this area; run booths along the
street, narrow alleys; at one end an outdoor theater; perhaps
connect the theater stage directly to the carnival
street, so the two spill into and feed one another.

 QUIET BACKS*

... the work places are given their general positJOn by SCATTERED
WORK   and their detailed organization and distribution
by WORK co MM UNITIES  1). It is essential though, that
they be supported by some kind of quiet, which is complementary
to the work. This pattern, and the next few patterns, gives the
structure of that quiet.
Any one who has to work in noise, in offices with people
all around, needs to be able to pause and refresh himself
with quiet in a more natural situation.
The walk along the Seine, through the middle of Paris, is a
classic "quiet back" in the middle of a fast city. People drop
down from the streets and the traffic and the commerce to stroll
along the river, where the mood is slow and reflective.
The need for such places has often been recognized in universities,
where there are quiet walks where people go to think, or
pause, or have a private talk. A beautiful case is the University of
Cambridge: each college has its "backs"-quiet courts stretching
down to the River Cam. But the need for quiet backs goes far
beyond the university. It exists everywhere where people work in
densely populated, noisy areas.
To meet this need, we may conceive all buildings as having
a front and a back. If the front is given over to the street lifccars,
shopping paths, delivery-then the back can be reserved
for quiet.
If the back is to be quiet, a place where you can hear only
natural sounds-winds, birds, water-it is critical that it be
protected. At the same time, it must be some way from the
buildings which it serves. This suggests a walk, some distance behind
the buildings, perhaps separated from them by their private
small gardens, completely protected by substantial walls and
dense planting along its length.
An example we know is the walk through the cathedral close in
Chichester. There is a high brick wall on each side of this walk
and flowers planted all along it. It leads away from the cathedral,

 QUIET BACKS
parallel but set back from the town's major road. On this path,
less than a block from the major crossroads of the town, you can
hear the bees buzzing.
If a number of these walks are connected, one to another, then
slowly, there emerges a ribbon-like system of tiny backs, pleasant
alleyways behind the commotion of the street. Since the sound of
water plays such a powerful role in establishing the kind of quiet
that is required, these paths should always connect up with the
local POOLS AND STREAMS 4). And the longer it can be, the
better.
Therefore:
Give the buildings in the busy parts of town a quiet
"back" behind them and away from the noise. Build a
walk along this quiet back, far enough from the building
so that it gets full sunlight, but protected from noise by
walls and distance and buildings. Make certain that the path
is not a natural shortcut for busy foot traffic, and connect
it up with other walks, to form a long ribbon of quiet alleyways
which converge on the local pools and streams and
the local greens.

 ACCESSIBLE GREEN**

... at the heart of neighborhoods, and near all work communities,
there need to be small greens-IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD
(14), WORK COMMUNITY 1). Of course it makes
the most sense to locate these greens in such a way that they help
form the boundaries and neighborhoods and backs-SUBCULTURE
BOUNDARY  I ), NEIGHBORHOOD BOUNDARY  I ), QUIET BACKS
(  ·
People need green open places to go to; when they are
close they use them. But if the greens are more than three
minutes away, the distance overwhelms the need.
Parks are meant to satisfy this need. But parks, as they are
usually understood, are rather large and widely spread through
the city. Very few people live within three minutes of a park.
Our research suggests that even though the need for parks is
very important, and even though it is vital for people to be able
to nourish themselves by going to walk, and run, and play on
open greens, this need is very delicate. The only people who
make full, daily use of parks are those who live less than three
minutes from them. The other people in a city who live more
than  minutes away, don't need parks any less; but distance discourages
use and so they are unable to nourish themselves, as
they need to do.
This problem can only be solved if hundreds of small parksor
greens-are scattered so widely, and so profusely, that every
house and every workplace in the city is within three minutes
walk of the nearest one.
In more detail: The need for parks within a city is well recognized.
A typical example of this awareness is given by the
results of a  citizen survey on open space conducted by the
Berkeley City Planning Department. The survey showed that
the great majority of people living in apartments want two kinds
of outdoor spaces above all others: a a pleasant, usable private
balcony and  a quiet public park within walking distance.
But the critical effect of distance on the usefulness of such
TOWNS
parks is less well known and understood. In order to study this
problem, we visited a small park in Berkeley, and asked 2
people who were in the park how often they came there, and
how far they had walked to the park. Specifically, we asked each
person three questions:
a. Did yon walk or drive?
b. How many blocks have you come'
c. How many days ago did you last visit the park/
On the basis of the first question we rejected five subjects who
had come by car or bike. The third question gave for each
person a measure of the number of times per week that person
comes to the park. For example,· if he last came three days ago, we
may estimate that he typically comes once per week. This is more
reliable than asking the frequency directly, since it relies on a
fact which the person is sure of, not on his judgment of a
rather intangible frequency.
We now construct a table showing the results. In the first
column, we write the number of blocks people walked to get to
the park. In the second column we write a measure of the area
of the ring-shaped zone which lies at that distance. The uea of
this ring-shaped zone is proportional to the difference of two
squares. For example, the measure of area of the ring at three
blocks, is  -   = .

In the third column, we write the number of people who have
come from that distance, each person multiplied by the number of
trips per week he makes to the park. This gives us a measure of
the total number of trips per week, which originate in that ring.
In the fourth column we write the number of trips per week
divided by the area of the ring. If we assume that people are
distributed throughout the entire area at approximately even
density, this gives us a measure of the probability that any one
person, in a given ring, will make a trip to the park in a given
week.
In the fifth column we write the logarithm base IO of this
probability measure P.
Simple inspection of these data shows that while the probability
measure, P, drops in half between one and two blocks, it drops
by a factor of four between two and three blocks. I ts rate of
decrease diminishes from then on. This indicates that an individual's
use of a park changes character radically if he lives
more than three blocks away.
For more precision let us examine the relationship between
distance and the logarithm of P. Under normal circumstances,
the frequency of access to a given center will vary according
to some distance decay function, such as P = Ae-Br, where
A and B are constants, and r is the radius. Th is means that if
behavior and motivation are constant with respect to distance, and
we plot the log of P against the radius, we should get a straight
line. Any aberration from the straight line will show us the
threshold where one kind of behavior and motivation changes to
another. This plot is shown below:

Beyond /quo or three blocks use of the green
drops off drastically.
TOWNS
We see that the resulting curve is S-shaped. It starts going down
at a certain angle, then gets much steeper, and then flattens out
again. Apparently there is a threshold somewhere between  and
 blocks, where people's behavior and motivation change drastically.
Those people who live in close proximity to a green follow
a high intensity use function-it has a steep gradient and it is
very sensitive to increasing distance. But those people who live
far from a green appear to adopt a low intensity use function
(indicated by a shallower gradient), and their behavior is not as
sensitive to distance. It is as if those people with ready access to a
green disp1ay a foll, free responsiveness to it; while people far
away have lost their awareness of it and have suffered a reduced
sensitivity to the pleasures of the green-for thees people, the
green has ceased to be a vital element in their neighborhood life.
Apparently, within a two to three block radius a three-minute
walking distance people are able to satisfy their need for access
to a green, but a greater distance seriously interferes with their
ability to meet this need.
This inference is rather unexpected. We know that people
who are close to a green go to it fairly often, presumably because
they need the relaxation. The people who live more than th_ree
minutes walk from the green also need the relaxation, presumably.
But in their case the distance prevents them from meeting
their need. It seems then, tl1at to meet this need, everyone-and
that means every house and every workplace-must be within
three minutes of such a park.
One question remains. How large must a green be in order
to satisfy this need? In functional terms this is easy to answer. It
mmt be large enough so that, at least in the middle of it, you
feel that you are in touch with nature, and away from the
hustle and bustle. Our current estimates suggest that a green
should be as much as 0, square feet in area, and at least I 0
feet wide in the narrowest direction in order to meet this requirement.
Therefore:
Build one open public green within three minutes' walk
-about  feet-of every house and workplace. This

... this pattern forms the core which makes an ACTIVITY NODE
(30): it can also help to generate a node, by its mere existence,
provided that it is correctly placed along the intersection of the
paths which people use most often. And it can also help to
generate a PROMENADE  I)' a WORK COMMUNITY 1)' an
IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD  ), through the action of the
people who gather there. But it is essential, in every case, that it
is not too large.
A town needs public squares; they are the largest, most
public rooms, that the town has. But when they are too
large, they look and feel deserted.
It is natural that every public street will swell out at those
important nodes where there is the most activity. And it is only
these widened, swollen, public squares which can accommodate
the public gatherings, small crowds, festivities, bonfires, carnivals,
speeches, dancing, shouting, mourning, which must have their
place in the life of the town.
But for some reason there is a temptation to make these
public squares too large. Time and again in modern cities, architects
and planners build plazas that are too large. They look
good on drawings; but in real life they end up desolate and dead.
Our observations suggest strongly that open places intended
as public squares should be very small. As a general rule, we have
found that they work best when they have a diameter of about
 feet-at this diameter people often go to them, they become
favorite places, and people feel comfortable there. When the
diameter gets above  feet, the squares begin to seem deserted
and unpleasant. The only exceptions we know are places like the
Piazza San Marco and Trafalgar Square, which are great town
centers, teeming with people.
What possible functional basis is there for these observations?
First, we know from the pattern, PEDESTRIAN DENSITY  ),
 I I
TOWNS

the other huge and deserted.
that a place begins to seem deserted when it has more than about
 square feet per person.
On this basis a square with a diameter of roo feet will begin
to seem deserted if there are less than   people in it. There are
few places in a city where you can be sure there will always be
people. On the other hand, it only takes  people to give life to
a square with a diameter of  feet, and only I  to give life to
a square with a diameter of  feet. Since there are far far better
chances of  or I  people being in a certain place than 3, the
smaller squares will feel comfortable for a far greater percentage
of the time.
The second possible basis for our observations depends on the
diameter. A person's face is just recognizable at about  feet;
and under typical urban noise conditions, a loud voice can just
barely be heard across  feet. This may mean that people feel
half-consciously tied together in plazas that have diameters of

 I SMALL PUBLIC SQUARES
 feet or less-where they can make out the faces and half-hear
the talk of the people around them; and this feeling of being at
one with a loosely knit square is lost in the larger spaces. Roughly
similar things have been said by Philip Thiel "An Architectural
and Urban Space Sequence Notation." unpublished ms., University
of California, Department of Architecture, August I 60,
p.  and by Hans Blumenfeld "Scale in Civic Design," Town
Planning Review, April 53, pp. -4'6). For example,
Blumenfeld gives the following figures: a person's face can be
recognized at up to  or  feet; a person's face can be recognized
as "a portrait," in rich detail, at up to about  feet.
Our own informal experiments show the following results.
Two people with normal vision can communicate comfortably
up to   feet. They can talk with raised voice, and they can see
the general outlines of the expression on one another's faces. This
  foot maximum is extremely reliable. Repeated experiments
gave the same distance again and again, ±Io per cent. At 00
feet it is uncomfortable to talk, and facial expression is no longer
clear. Anything above  feet is hopeless.
Therefore:
Make a public square much smaller than you would at
first imagine; usually no more than  to  feet across,
never more than  feet across. This applies only to its
width in the short direction. In the long direction it can
certainly be longer.

An even better estimate for the size of the square: make a
guess about the number of people who will typically be there
(say, P), and make the area of the square no greater than I  to

 HIGH PLACES*
 I
... according to FOUR-STORY LIMIT   I), most roofs in the
community are no higher than four stories, about  or  feet.
However, it is very important that this height limit be punctuated,
just occasionally, by higher buildings which have special
functions. They can he] p the character of the SMALL PUBLIC

identity to their communities, provided that they do not occur
more frequently than one in each COMMUNITY OF   I ).

The instinct to climb up to some high place, from which
you can look down and survey your world, seems to be a
fundamental human instinct.
The tiniest hamlets have a dominating landmark-usually the
church tower. Great cities have hundreds of them. The instinct
to build these towers is certainly not merely Christian; the same
thing happens in different cultures and religions, all over the
world. Persian villages have pigeon towers; Turkey, its minarets;
San Gimignano, its houses in the form of towers; castles, their
lookouts; Athens, its Acropolis; Rio, its rock.
These high places have two separate and complementary functions.
They give people a place to climb up to, from which they
can look down upon their world. And they give people a place
which they can see from far away and orient themselves toward,
when they are on the ground.
Listen to Proust:
Combray at a distance, from a twenty-mile radius, as we used to
see it from the railway when we arrived there every year in Holy
Week, was no more than a church epitomising the town, representing
it, speaking of it and for it to the horizon, and as one drew near,
gathering close about its long, dark cloak, sheltering from the wind,
on the open plain, as a shepherd gathers his sheep, the woolly grey
backs of its blocking houses ....
From a long way off one could distinguish and identify the steeple
of Sainte-Hilaire inscribing its unforgetable form upon a horizon beneath
which Combray had not yet appeared; when from the train

Way.)
Oxford: the city of dreaming spires.
High places are equally important, too, as· places from which
to look down: places that give a spectacular, comprehensive view
of the town. Visitors can go to them to get a sense of the entire
area they have come to; and the people who live there can do so
too--to reassess the shape and scope of their surroundings. But
these visits to the high places will have no freshness or exhilaration
if there is a ride to the top in a car or elevator. To get a full
sense of the magnificence of the view, it seems necessary to work
for it, to leave the car or elevator, and to climb. The act of
climbing, even if only for a few steps, clears the mind and prepares
the body.
As for distribution, we suggest about one of these high places
for each community of 000, high enough to be seen throughout
the community. If high places are Jess frequent, they tend to be
too special, and they have less power as landmarks.
Therefore:
Build occasional high places as landmarks throughout the
city. They can be a natural part of the topography, or
towers, or part of the roofs of the highest local buildingbut,
in any case, they should include a physical climb.

  DANCING IN THE STREET*
... several patterns have laid the groundwork for evening
activity in public-MAGIC OF THE CITY IO) PROMENADE   I))
NIGHT LIFE   ), CARNIVAL   ), SMALL PUBLIC SQUARES   I).
To make these places alive at night, there is nothing like music
and dancing; this pattern simply states the physical conditions
which will encourage dancing and music to fill the streets.

Why is it that people don't dance in the streets today?
All over the earth, people once danced in the streets; in
theater, song, and natural speech, "dancing in the street" is an
image of supreme joy. Many cultures still have some version of
this activity. There are the Balinese dancers who fall into a
trance whirling around in the street; the mariachi bands in Mexicc--
evcry town has several squares where the bands play and the
neighborhood comes out to dance; there is the European and
American tradition of bandstands and jubilees in the park; there
is the hon odori festival in Japan, when everybody claps and
dances in the streets.
But in those parts of the world that have become "modern"
and technically sophisticated, this experience has died. Communities
are fragmented; people are uncomfortable in the streets,
afraid with one another; not many people play the right kind
of music; people are embarrassed.
Certainly there is no way in which a change in the environment,
as simple as the one which we propose, can remedy these
circumstances. But we detect a change in mood. The embarrassment
and the alienation are recent developments, blocking a more
basic need. And as we get in touch with these needs, things start
to happen. People remember how to dance; everyone takes up an
instrument; many hundreds form little bands. At this writing,
in San Francisco, Berkeley, and Oakland there is a controversy
over "street musicians"-bands that have spontaneously begun
playing in streets and plazas whenever the weather is goodwhere
should they be allowed to play, do they obstruct traffic,
shall people dance?

 DANCING IN THE STREET
It is in this atmosphere that we propose the pattern. Where
there is feeling for the importance of the activity re-emerging,
then the right setting can actualize it and give it roots. The essentials
are straightforward: a platform for the musicians, perhaps
with a cover; hard surface for dancing, all around the bandstand;
places to sit and Jean for people who want to watch and rest;
provision for some drink and refreshment some Mexican bandstands
have a beautiful way of building tiny stalls into the base of
the bandstand, so that people are drawn though the dancers and
up to the music, for a fruit drink or a beer); the whole thing set
somewhere where people congregate.
Therefore:
Along promenades, in squares and evening centers, make
a slightly raised platform to form a bandstand, where street
musicians and local bands can play. Cover it, and perhaps
build in at ground level tiny stalls for refreshment. Surround
the bandstand with paved surface for dancing-no
admission charge.

 POOLS AND STREAMS*

... the land, in its natural state, is hardly ever flat, and was, in
its most primitive condition, overrun with rills and streams
which carried off the rainwater. There is no reason to destroy this
natural feature of the land in a town-SACRED SITES  ), ACCESS
To WATER )-in fact, it is essential that it be preserved, or
recreated. And in doing so it will be possible to deepen several
larger patterns-boundaries between neighborhoods can easily be
formed by streams-NEIGHBORHOOD BOUNDARY  r ), quiet backs

We came from the water; our bodies are largely water;
and water plays a fundamental role in our psychology. We
need constant access to water, all around us; and we cannot
have it without reverence for water in all its forms.
But everywhere in cities water is out of reach.
Even in the temperate climates that are water rich, the natural
sources of water are dried up, hidden, covered, lost. Rainwater
runs underground in sewers; water reservoirs are covered and
fenced off; swimming pools are saturated with chlorine and
fenced off; ponds are so polluted that no one wants to go near
them any more.
And especially in heavily populated areas water is scarce. We
cannot possibly have the daily access to it which we and our
children need, unless all water, in all its forms, is exposed, preserved,
and nourished in an endless local texture of small pools,
ponds, reservoirs, and streams in every neighborhood.
There are various ways of expressing the connection between
people and water. The biologist, L. J. Henderson, observed that
the saline content of human blood is essentially the same as that of
the sea, because we came from the sea. Elaine Morgan, an anthropologist,
speculates that during the drought of the Pliocene era,
we went back to the sea and lived ro million years as sea mam-·
TOWNS
mals in the shallow waters along the edge of the ocean. Apparently,
this hypothesis explains a great deal about the human
body, the way in which it is adapted to water, which is otherwise
obscure The Descent of Woman, New York: Bantam
Books,  ).
Furthermore, among psychoanalysts it is common to consider
the bodies of water that appear in people's dreams as loaded with
meaning. Jung and the Jungian analysts take great bodies of
water as representing the dreamer's unconscious. We even
speculate, in light of the psychoanalytic evidence, that going into
the water may bring a person closer to the unconscious processes
in his life. We guess that people who swim and dive often, in
lakes and pools and in the ocean, may be closer to their dreams,
more in contact with their unconscious, than people who swim
rarely. Several studies have in fact demonstrated that water has
a positive therapeutic effect; that it sets up growth experience.
(For references, see Ruth Hartley et al., Understanding Children's
Play, Columbia University Press, New York: 64, Chapter
V).
All of this suggests that our lives are diminished if we cannot
establish rich and abiding contact with water. But of course, in
most cities we cannot. Swimming pools, lakes, and beaches are
few in number and far away. And consider also the water supply.
Our only contact with this water is to turn on the tap. We take
the water for granted. But as marvelous as the high technology
of water treatment and distribution has become, it does not
satisfy the emotional need to make contact with the local reservoirs,
and to understand the cycle of water: its limits and its
mystery.
But it is possible to imagine a town where there are many
hundreds of places near every home and workplace where there
is water. Water to swim in, water to sit beside, water where you
can dangle your feet. Consider, for example, the running water:
the brooks and streams. Today they are paved over and forced
underground. Instead of building with them, and alongside them,
planners simply get them out of the way, as if to say: "the
vagaries of nature have no place in a rational street grid." But
we can build in ways which maintain contact with water, in
ponds and pools, in reservoirs, and in brooks and streams. We can

 POOLS AND STREAMS
even build details that connect people with the collection and
run-off of rain water.
Think of the shallow ponds and pools that children need. It
is possible for these pools and ponds to be available throughout
the city, close enough for children to walk to. Some can be part
of the larger pools. Others tan be bulges of streams that run
through the city, where a balanced ecology is allowed to develop
along their edges-ponds with ducks and carp, with edges safe
enough for children to come close.
And consider the system of local and distribution reservoirs.
We can locate local reservoirs and distribution reservoirs so that
people can get at them; we might build them as kinds of shrines,
where people can come to get in touch with the source of their
water supply; the place immediately around the water an atmosphere
inviting contemplation. These shrines could be set into
the public space: perhaps as one end of a promenade, or as a
boundary of common land between two communities.

Indian stepped well.
And think of running water, in all its possible forms. People
who have been deprived of it in their daily surroundings go to
great lengths to get out of their towns into the countryside, where
they can watch a river flow, or sit by a stream and gaze at the
water. Children are fascinated by running water. They use it
endlessly, to play in, to throw sticks and see them disappear, to
run little paper boats along, to stir up mud and watch it clear
gradually.
TOWNS
Natural streams in their original strearnbeds, together with
their surrounding vegetation, can be preserved and maintained.
Rainwater can be allowed to assemble from rooftops into small
pools and to run through channels along garden paths and public
pedestrian paths, where it can be seen and enjoyed. Fountains
can be built in public places. And in those cities where streams
have been buried, it may even be possible to unravel them again.
T lie buried streams.
In summary, we propose that every building project, at every
scale, take stock of the distribution of water and the access to
water in its neighborhood. Where there is a gap, where nourishing
contact with water is missing, then each project should make
some attempt, on its own and in combination with other projects,
to bring some water into the environment. There is no other
way to build up an adequate texture of water in cities: we need
pools for swimming, ornamental and natural pools, streams of
rain water, fountains, falls, natural brooks and streams rnnning
through towns, tiny garden pools, and reservoirs we can get to
and appreciate.
Therefore:
Preserve natural pools and streams and allow them to
run through the city; make paths for people to walk along
them and footbridges to cross them. Let the streams form
natural barriers in the city, with traffic crossing them only
infrequently on bridges.
 POOLS AND STREAMS
Whenever possible, collect rainwater in open gutters
and allow it to Row above ground, along pedestrian paths
and in front of houses. In places without natural running
water, create fountains in the streets.

BIRTH PLACES
... both birth and death need recogn1t10n throughout society,
where people are, as part of local communities and neighborhoods-
COMMUNITY OF   )' IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD
( r ), LIFE CYCLE  ). As far as birth is concerned, each
group of neighborhoods must be able to take care of the birth
process, in local, human terms. Note: The development of this
pattern is due largely to the work of Judith Shaw, at this writing
a graduate student in architecture at the University of California,
Berkeley, and a mother of three children.)
It seems unlikely that any process which treats childbirth
as a sickness could possibly be a healthy part of a
healthy society.
"Pregnancy is no state of emergency from which the mother
may hopefully be returned to 'normality' after the birth of the
child .... It is a highly active, potent, developmental process of
the family going forward to its natural culmination in delivery."
(I. H. Pearse and L. H. Crocker, The Peckham Experiment,
New Haven: Yale University Press, 46, p. )
The existing obstetrics service in most hospitals follows a well
outlined procedure. Having a baby is thought of as an illness and
the stay in the hospital as recuperation. Women who are about to
deliver are treated as "patients" about to undergo surgery. They
are sterilized. Their genitals are scrubbed and shaved. They
are gowned in white, and put on a table to be moved back and
forth between the various parts of the hospital. Women in labor
are put in cubicles to pass the time with virtually no social contact.
Th is time can last for many hours. It is a time when
father and children could be present to provide encouragement.
But this is not permitted. Delivery usually takes place in a
"delivery room" which has the proper "table" for childbirth.
 BIRTH PLACES
Except for the particular workings of the delivery table the room
has the same properties as an operating theater. The birth becomes
a time for separation rather than togetherness. It may be
as long as I z hours before the mother is even allowed to touch
her baby, and if she was sedated for the delivery, even longer
before she may see her husband.
For about fifteen years there has been a subtle movement to
try and recapture the essence of childbirth as a natural phenomenon.
There has been no loud protest against obstetricians and
hospital rules, but a rather quiet one: several good books, word
of mouth, concerned professionals and nonprofessionals, the La
Leche League, a few groups around the country whose prime
concern is with birth, and the re-emergence of the nurse-midwife.
The original effort of these people was aimed at "natural" childbirth,
the name being applied in an attempt to bring the concept
of childbirth back to a normal physiological occurrence. Lately
the focus of the effort has been expanded to include an altered
environment for childbirth and to include the family in a positive
way. For an architectural slant, see Lewis Mumford, The
Urban Pro1pect, New York: Harcourt Brace and World, 68,
p.  .)
We quote now from Judith Shaw's description of a good birth
place. She is describing a place comparable to a small nursing
home, perhaps associated with a local health center, and with
emergency connections to the local hospital:
A small basket for the baby would be provided .... The nursemidwife
would be there always to provide post-partum care ....
The nurse-midwife, who lives in, would have a small suite containing
a bedroom, sitting room-kitchen and bath ....
The eating place would be communal. Each baby would have a
place too his movable basket so that the mother can bring her
child with her to feed or to watch .... The pattern FARMHOUSE
KITCHEN    could play an important role in this building .
. . . families can come not only to have babies but have their prenatal
care, learn methods of natural childbirth, possibly child care,
maybe just to talk and in general to become familiar with the place
they will come to for the delivery.
The birthing place should have accommodations for the entire
family. They can occupy a suite in which they live and in which the
mother gives birth to the baby .... Since the delivery would take
place in the family suite, the baby, mother, and the family can be
TOWNS
together immediately. Each suite would have to be equipped with
running water and a simple table on which to lay the baby, wash it
and give it its initial examination.
Therefore:
Build local birth places where women go to have their
children: places that are specially tailored to childbirth as
a natural, eventful moment-where the entire family comes
for prenatal care and education; where fathers and midwives
help during the hours of labor and birth.

 HOLY GROUND*
....
  I
... we have defined the need for a full life cycle, with rites of
passage between stages of the cycle-LIFE CYCLE   ; and we
have recommended that certain pieces of land be set aside because
of their importance and meaning-SACRED SITES ).
This pattern gives the detailed organization of the space around
these places. The organization is so powerful, that to some extent
it can itself create the sacredness of sites, perhaps even encourage
the slow emergence of coherent rites of passage.
What is a church or temple? It is a place of worship,
spirit, contemplation, of course. But above all, from a
human point of view, it is a gateway. A person comes into
the world through the church. He leaves it through the
church. And, at each of the important thresholds of his
life, he once again steps through the church.
The rites that accompany birth, puberty, marriage, and death
are fundamental to human growth. Unless these rites are given
the emotional weight they need, it is impossible for a man or
woman to pass thoroughly from one stage of life to another.
In all traditional societies, where these rites are treated with
enormous power and respect, the rites, in one form or another,
are supported by parts of the physical environment which have
the character of gates. Of course, a gate, or gateway, by itself
cannot create a rite. But it is also true that the rites cannot evolve
in an environment which specifically ignores them or makes them
trivial. A hospital is no place for a baptism; a funeral home makes
it impossible to feel the meaning of a funeral.
In functional terms, it is essential that each person have the
opportunity to enter into some kind of social communion with his
fellows at the times when he himself or his friends pass through
these critical points in their lives. And this social communion at
this moment needs to be rooted in some place which is recognized
as a kind of spiritual gateway for these events.
\,Vhat physical shape or organization must this "gateway" have

 HOLY GROUND
in order to support the rites of passage, and m order to create
the sanctity and holiness and feeling of connection to the earth
which makes the rites significant.
Of course, it will vary in detail, from culture to culture. Whatever
it is exactly that is held to be sacred-whether it is nature,
god, a special place, a spirit, .holy relics, the earth itself, or an
idea-it takes different forms, in different cultures, and requires
different physical environments to support it.
However, we do believe that one fundamental characteristic is
invariant from culture to culture. In all cultures it seems that
whatever it is that is holy will only be felt as holy, if it is hard to
reach, if it requires layers of access, waiting, levels of approach, a
gradual unpeeling, gradual revelation, passage through a series of
gates. There are many examples: the Inner City of Peking; the
fact that anyone who has audience with the Pope must wait in
each of seven waiting rooms; the Aztec sacrifices took place on
stepped pyramids, each step closer to the sacrifice; the Ise shrine,
the most famous shrine in Japan, is a nest of precincts, each one
inside the other.
Layers of access.
Even in an ordinary Christian church, you pass first through
the churchyard, then through the nave; then, on special occasions,
beyond the altar rail into the chancel and only the priest himself
is able to go into the tabernacle. The holy bread is sheltered by
five layers of ever more difficult approach.
This layering, or nesting of precincts, seems to correspond to

TOWNS
a fundamental aspect of human psychology. We believe that
every community, regardless of its particular faith, regardless of
whether it even has a faith in any organized sense, needs some
place where this feeling of slow, progressive access through gates
to a holy center may be experienced. When such a place exists in .1
community, even if it is not associated with any particular religion,
we believe that the feeling of holiness, in some form or other, will
gradually come to life there among the people who share in the
experience.
Therefore:
In each community and neighborhood, identify some
sacred site as consecrated ground, and form a series of
nested precincts, e·ach marked by a gateway, each one
progressively more private, and more sacred than the last,
the innermost a final sanctum that can only be reached by
passing through all of the outer ones.
At each threshold between precincts build a gate-MAIN GATEWAYS
( ); at each gate, a place to pause with a new view toward
the next most inner place-ZEN VIEW  I ); and at the innermost
sanctum, something very quiet and able to inspire-perhaps
a 0view, or no more than a simple tree, or pool-POOLS AND
sfREAMS 4), TREE PLACES 1). , . ,

in each house cluster and work community, provide
the smaller bits of common land, to provide for local
versions of the same needs:

 COMMON LAND**

. . . just as there is a need for public land at the neighborhood
level-ACCESSIBLE GREEN  0), so also, within the clusters and
work communities from which the neighborhoods are made, there
is a need for smaller and more private kinds of common land
shared by a few work groups or a few families. This common
land, in fact, forms the very heart and soul of any cluster. Once
it is defined, the individual buildings of the cluster form around
it-HOUSE CLUSTER ), ROW HOUSES ), HOUSING HILL
(39), WORK COMMUNITY 1).
Without common land no social system can survive.
In pre-industrial soc1et1es, common land between houses and
between workshops existed automatically-so it was never necessary
to make a point of it. The paths and streets which gave access
to buildings were safe, social spaces, and therefore functioned
automatically as common land.
But in a society with cars and trucks, the common land which
can play an effective social role in knitting people together no
longer happens automatically. Those streets which carry cars and
trucks at more than crawling speeds, definitely do not function
as common land; ,and many buildings find themselves entirely
isolated from the social fabric because they are not joined to one
another by land they hold in common. In such a situation common
land must be provided, separately, and with deliberation,
as a social necessity, as vital as the streets.
The common land has two specific social functions. First, the
land makes it possible for people to feel comfortable outside their
buildings and their private territory, and therefore allows them
to feel connected to the larger social system-though not necessarily
to any specific neighbor. And second, common land acts as
a meeting place for people.
The first function is subtle. Certainly one's immediate neighbors
are less important in modern society than in traditional

TOWNS
society. This is because people meet friends at work, at school,
at meetings of interest groups and therefore no longer rely exclusively
on neighbors for friendship. See for instance, Melvin
Webber, "Order in Diversity: Community Without Propinquity,"
Cities and Space, ed. Lowdon vVingo, Baltimore: Resources
for the Future, 63; and vVebber, "The Urban Place
and the Nonplace Urban Realm," in Webber et al., Explorations
into Urban Structure, Philadelphia, 64, pp. - .)
To the extent that this is true, the common land between
houses might be less important than it used to be as a meeting
ground for friendship. But the common land between buildings
may have a deeper psychological function, which remains important,
even when people have no relation to their neighbors.
In order to portray this function, imagine that your house is
separated from the city by a gaping chasm, and that you have to
pass across this chasm every time you leave your house, or enter it.
The house would be disturbingly isolated; and you, in the
house, would be isolated from society, merely by this physical
fact. In psychological terms, we believe that a building without
common land in front of it is as isolated from society as if it had
just such a chasm there.
There is a new emotional disorder-a type of agoraphobiamaking
its appearance in today's cities. Victims of this disorder
are afraid to go out of their houses for any reason-even to
mail a letter or to go to the corner grocery store-literally, they
are afraid of the marketplace-the agora. We speculate-entirely
without evidence-that this disorder may be reinforced by the
absence of common land, by an environment in which people
feel they have no "right" to be outside their own front doors.
If this is so, agoraphobia would be the most concrete manifestation
of the breakdown of common land.
The second social function of common land is straightforward.
Common land provides a meeting ground for the fluid, common
activities that a house cluster shares. The larger pieces of public
land which serve neighborhoods-the parks, the community facilities-
do not fill the bill. They are fine for the neighborhood as
a whole. But they do not provide a base for the functions that
are common to a cluster of households.
 COMMON LAND
Lewis Mum ford:
Even in housing estates that are laid out at twelve families to the
acre-perhaps one should say especially there-there is often a lack
of common meeting places for the mothers, where, on a good day,
they might come together under a big tree, or a pergola, to sew or
gossip, while their infants slept in a pram or their runabout children
grubbed around in a play pit. Perhaps the best part of Sir Charles
Reilly's plans for village greens was that they provided for such
common activities: as the planners of Sunnyside, Long Island, Messrs.
Stein and Wright, had done as early as 24. The Urban Prospect,
New York: Harcourt, Brace and World, 68, p. .)
How much common land must there be? There must be
enough to be useful, to contain children's games and small
gatherings. And enough land must be common so that private
land doesn't dominate it psychologically. We guess that the
amount of common land needed in a neighborhood is on the
order of  per cent of the land held privately. This is the figure
that the greenbelt planners typically devoted to their commons
and greens. See Clarence Stein, Toward New Towns in America,
Cambridge: M.I.T. Press, 66.)
With cooperation among the people, it is possible to build this
pattern piecemeal, into our existing neighborhoods by closing
streets.

... suppose the common land that connects clusters to one
another is being provided-COMMON LAND ). Within this

and, above all, to make sure that the relationship between adjacent
pieces of common land allows this play space to form.
If children don't play enough with other children during
the first five years of life, there is a great chance that they
will have some kind of mental illness later in their lives.
Children need other children. Some findings suggest that they
need other children even more than they need their own mothers.
And empirical evidence shows that if they are forced to spend
their early years with too little contact with other children, they
will be likely to suffer from psychosis and neurosis in their later
years.
Alone
Since the layout of the land between the houses in a neighborhood
virtually controls the formation of play groups, it therefore
has a critical effect on people's mental health. A typical suburban
subdivision with private lots opening off streets almost confines

 CONNECTED PLAY
children to their houses. Parents, afraid of traffic or of their neighbors,
keep their small children indoors or in their own gardens:
so the children never have enough chance meetings with other
children of their own age to form the groups which are essential
to a healthy emotional development.
We shall show that children will only be able to have the access
to other children which they need, if each household opens onto
some kind of safe, connected common land, which touches at least
 other households.
First, let us review the evidence for the problem. The most
dramatic evidence comes from the Harlows' work on monkeys.
The Harlows have shown that monkeys isolated from other infant
monkeys during the first six months of life are incapable of normal
social, sexual, or play relations with other monkeys in their later
lives:
They exhibit abnormalities of behavior rarely seen in animals born
in the wild. They sit in their cages and stare fixedly into space, circle
their cages in a repetitively stereotyped manner, and clasp their heads
in their hands or arms and rock for long periods of time ... the
animal may chew and tear at its body until it bleeds ... similar
symptoms of emotional pathology are observed in deprived children
in orphanages and in withdrawn adolescents and adults in mental
hospitals. Henry F. Harlow and Margaret K. Harlow, "The Effect
of Rearing Conditions on Behavior," Bull. Menniger Clinic, ,
1962, pp. 13-14.)
It is well known that infant monkeys-like infant human beings-
have these defects if brought up without a mother or a
mother surrogate. It is not well known that the effects of separation
from other infant monkeys are even stronger than the effects
of maternal deprivation. Indeed, the Harlows showed that although
monkeys can be raised successfully without a mother, provided
that they have other infant monkeys to play with, they
cannot be raised successfully by a mother alone, without other
infant monkeys, even if the mother is entirely normal. They conclude:
"It seems possible that the infant-mother affectional system
is dispensable, whereas the infant-infant system is a sine-qua-non
for later adjustment in all spheres of monkey life." Harry F.
Harlow and Margaret K. Harlow, "Social Deprivation in Monkeys,"
Scientific American, 07, No. , 62, pp. -46.)

TOWNS
The first six months of a rhesus monkey's life correspond to the
first three years of a child's life. Although there is no formal evidence
to show that lack of contact during these first three years
damages human children-and as far as we know, it has never
been studied-there is very strong evidence for the cff ect of isolation
between the ages of four to ten.
Herman Lantz questioned a random sample of , men in
the United States Army, who had been referred to a mental
hygiene clinic because of emotional difficulties. Herman K.
Lantz, "Number of Childhood Friends as Reported in the Life
Histories of a Psychiatrically Diagnosed Group of I ,ooo," Marriage
and Family Life, May 56, pp.  08. Army psychiatrists
classified each of the men as normal, suffering from
mild psychoneurosis, severe psychoneurosis, or psychosis. Lantz
then put each man into one of three categories: those who reported
having five friends or more at any typical moment when
they were between four and ten years old, those who reported an
average of about two friends, and those who reported having no
friends at that time. The following table shows the relative percentages
in each of the three friendship categories separately. The
results are astounding:

On the positive side, an informal account by Anna Freud shows
how powerful the effect of contact among tiny children can be
on the emotional development of the children. She describes five
young German children who lost their parents during infancy

 CONNECTED PLAY
in a concentration camp, and then looked after one another inside
the camp until the war ended, at which point they were brought
to England. Anna Freud and Sophie Dann, "An Experiment in
Group Upbringing," Reading in Child Behavior and Development,
ed. Celia Stendler, New York, 64, pp. 2-40. She
describes the beautiful social and emotional maturity of these
tiny children. Reading the account, one feels that these children,
at the age of three, were more aware of each other and more
sensitive to each other's needs than many people ever are.
It is almost certain, then, that contact is essential, and that
lack of contact, when it is extreme, has extreme effects. A considerable
body of literature beyond that which we have quoted,
is given in Christopher Alexander, "The City as a Mechanism
for Sustaining Human Contact," Environment for Man, ed.
W. R. Ewald, Indiana University Press, Bloomington, 67, pp.
60-!09.
If we assume that informal, neighborhood contact between
children is a vital experience, we may then ask what kinds of
neighborhoods support the formation of spontaneous play groups.
The answer, we believe, is some form of safe common land, connected
to a child's home, and from which he can make contact
with several other children. The critical question is: How many
households need to share this connected play space?
The exact number of households that are required depends on
the child population within the households. Let us assume that
children represent about one-fourth of a given population slightly
less than the modal figure for suburban households), and that
these children are evenly distributed in age from o to .
Roughly speaking, a given pre-school child who is x years old will
play with children who are x -  or x or x +  years old. In order
to have a reasonable amount of contact, and in order for
playgroups to form, each child must be able to reach at least five
children in his age range. Statistical analysis shows that for each
child to have a  per cent chance of reaching five such potential
playmates, each child must be in reach of  households.
The problem may be stated as follows: In an infinite population
of children, one-sixth are the right age and five-sixths are
the wrong age for any given child. A group of r children is

TOWNS
chosen at random. The probability that this group of r children

contains  or more right-age children in it is I - IP,., ,, where
le= o
P,., k is the hypergeometric distribution. If we now ask what is the

least r which makes I - .IP,., k > 0.95, · turns out to be 4.
I<= o
I  we need  children, we need a total population of
4(54 = 16, which at . persons per household, needs 4
households.
Sixty-four is a rather large number of households to share connected
common land. In fact, in the face of this requirement,
there is a strong temptation to try to solve the problem by grouping
IO or  homes in a cluster. But this will not work: while it
is a useful configuration for other reasons-HOUSE CLUSTER )
and COMMON LAND )-by itself it will not solve the problem
of connected play space for children. There must also be safe paths
to connect the bits of common ]and.
Connecting paths.
Therefore:
Lay out common land, paths, gardens, and bridges so
that groups of at least  households are connected by a

PUBLIC OUTDOOR ROOM**
... the common land in MAIN GATEWAYS(  ), ACCESISR LE
GREEN 0), SMALLP UBLIC SQUARES( r), COMMONL AND( ),
PEDESTRIAN STREET  I 00), PATHS AND GOALS  I 0 needs at
least some place where hanging out and being "out" in public
become possible. For this purpose it is necessary to distinguish
one part of the common land and to define it with a little more
elaboration. Also, if none of the larger patterns exist yet, this
pattern can act as a nucleus, and help them to crystallize around it.
There are very few spots along the streets of modern
towns and neighborhoods where people can hang out,
comfortably, for hours at a time.
Men seek corner beer shops, where they spend hours talking
and drinking; teenagers, especially boys, choose special corners
too, where they hang around, waiting for their friends. Old people
like a special spot to go to, where they can expect to find
others; small children need sand lots, mud, plants, and water to
play with in the open; young mothers who go to watch their
children often use the children's play as an opportunity to meet
and talk with other mothers.
Because of the diverse and casual nature of these activities, they
require a space which has a subtle balance of being defined and
yet not too defined, so that any activity which is natural to the
neighborhood at any given time can develop freely and yet has
something to start from.
For example, it would be possible to leave an outdoor room
unfinished, with the understanding it can be finished by people
who live nearby, to fill whatever needs seem most pressing. It
may need sand, or water faucets, or play equipment for small
children-ADVENTURE PLAYGROUND( ); it may have steps and
seats, where teenagers can meet-TEENAGE SOCIETY 4); someone
may build a smalJ bar or coffee shop in a house that opens
into the area, with an arcade, making the arcade a place to eat and

TOWNS
drin k-FooD STANDS    ; there may be games like chess and
checkers for old people.
Modern housing projects especially suffer from the lack of this
kind of space. When indoor community rooms are provided, they
are rarely used. People don't want to plunge into a situation
which they don't know; and the degree of involvement created
in such an enclosed space is too intimate to allow a casual passing
interest to build up gradually. On the other hand, vacant land is
not enclosed enough. It takes years for anything to happen on
vacant land; it provides too little shelter, and too little "reason to
be there."
What is needed is a framework which is just enough deli ned
so that people naturally tend to stop there; and so that curiosity
naturally takes people there, and invites them to stay. Then, once
community groups begin to gravitate toward this framework, there
is a good chance that they will themselves, if they are permitted,
create an environment which is appropriate to their activities.
We conjecture that a small open space, roofed, with columns,
but without walls at least in part, will just about provide the
necessary balance of "openness" and "closedness."
A beautiful example of the pattern was built by Dave Chapin
and George Gordon with architecture students from Case Western
Reserve in Cleveland, Ohio. They built a sequence of public out-

door rooms on the grounds and on the public land surrounding
a local mental health clinic. According to staff reports, these
places changed the life of the clinic dramatically: many more
people than had been usual were drawn into the outdoors, public
talk was more animated, outdoor space that had always been
dominated by automobiles suddenly became human and the
cars had to inch along.
In all, Chapin and Gordon and their crew built seven public
outdoor rooms in the neighborhood. Each one was slightly different,
varying according to views, orientation, size.
We have also discovered a version of this pattern from medieval
society. Apparently, in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries there
were many such public structures dotted through the towns. They
were the scene of auctions, open-air meetings, and market fairs.
They are very much in the spirit of the places we are proposing
for neighborhoods and work communities.

... according to LIFE CYCLE  the transitions of a person's

no exception. This pattern helps to integrate the fact of death
with the public spaces of each neighborhood, and, by its very
existence, helps to form IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOODS  ), and
HOLY GROUND 6 and COMMON LAND ).

No people who turn their backs on death can be alive.
The presence of the dead among the living will be a daily
fact in any society which encourages its people to live.
Huge cemeteries on the outskirts of cities, or in places no one
ever visits, impersonal funeral rites, taboos which hide the fact of
death from children, all conspire to keep the fact of death away
from us, the living. If you live in a modern suburb, ask yourself
how comfortable you would be if your house were next to a
graveyard. Very likely the thought frightens you. But this is only
because we are no longer used to it. We shall be healthy, when
graves of friends and family, and memorials to the people of the
recent and the distant past, are intermingled with our houses, in
small grave yards, as naturally as winter always comes before the
spring.
In every culture there is some form of intense ceremony surrounding
death, grieving for the dead, and disposal of the body.
There are thousands of variations, but the point is always to give
the community of friends left alive the chance to reconcile themselves
to the facts of death: the emptiness, the loss; their own
transience.
These ceremonies bring people into contact with the experience
of mortality, and in this way, they bring us closer to the
facts of life, as well as death. When these experiences are integrated
with the environment and each person's life, we are able
to live through them fully and go on. But when circumstances
or custom prevent us from making contact with the experience
of mortality, and living with it, we are left depressed, diminished,

 GRAVE SITES
less alive. There is a great deal of clinical evidence to support this
notion.
In one documented case, a young boy lost his grandmother; the
people around him told him that she had merely "gone away" to
"protect his feelings." The boy was uneasily aware that something
had happened, but in this atmosphere of secrecy, could not
know it for what it was and could not therefore experience it
fully. Instead of being protected, he became a victim of a massive
neurosis, which was only cured, many years later, when he finally
recognized, and lived through the fact of his grandmother's
death.
This case, and others which make it abundantly clear that a
person must live through the death of those he loves as fully as
possible, in order to remain emotionally healthy, have been
described by Eric Lindemann. We have lost the crucial reference
for this work, but two other papers by Lindemann converge on
the same point: "Symptomatology and Management of Acute
Grief," American Journal of Psychiatry, 44, IOI, 1-48;
and "A Study of Grief: Emotional Responses to Suicide," Pastoral
Psychology, 53, (39), -13. We also recommend a recent
paper by Robert Kastenbaum, on the ways in which children explore
their mortality: "The Kingdom Where Nobody Dies,"

In the big industrial cities, during the past  years, the
ceremonies of death and their functional power for the living have

TOWNS
been completely undermined. What were once beautifully simple
forms of mourning have been replaced by grotesque cemeteries,
plastic flowers, everything but the reality of death. And above
all, the small graveyards which once put people into daily contact
with the foct of death, have vanished-replaced by massive
cemeteries, far away from people's daily business.
What must be done to set things right? We can solve the
problem by fusing some of the old ritual forms with the kinds of
situations we face today.
 Most important, it is essential to break down the scale of
modern cemeteries, and to reinstate the connection between
burial grounds and local communities. Intense decentralization: a
person can choose a spot for himself, in parks, common lands, on
his land.
 The right setting re(Juires some enclosure; paths beside the
gravesites; the graves visible, and protected by low walls, edges,
trees.
 Property rights. There must be some levl basis for hallowing
small pieces of ground-to give a guuantee that the ground a
person chooses will not be sold and developed.
 With increasing population, it is obviously impossible to go
on and on covering the land with graves or memorials. We suggest
a process similar to the one followed in traditional Greek
villages. The graveyards occupy a fixed area, enough to cope with
the dead of  years. After  years, remains are put out to
sea-except for those whose memory is still alive.
 The ritual itself has to evolve from a group with some
shared values, at least a family, perhaps a group that shares a
religious view. Three of the basics: friends carrying the casket
through the streets in procession; simple pine coffins or urns;
gathering round the grave.
Therefore:
Never build massive cemeteries. Instead, allocate pieces
of land throughout the community as grave sites-corners
of parks, sections of paths, gardens, beside gateways-where
memorials to people who have died can be ritually placed
with inscriptions and mementos which celebrate their life.

Give each grave site an edge, a path, and a quiet corner
where people can sit. By custom, this is hallowed ground.

 STILL WATER*
... the patterns ACCESS TO WATER    and POOLS AND STREAMS
(64 provide a variety of kinds of water throughout the community.
This pattern helps to embellish the still waters-the
pools and ponds and swimming holes-and provide them with a
safe edge for children. It also helps to differentiate the public
space in HOUSE CLUSTER ), WORK COMMUNITY 1), HEALTH
CENTER ), COMMON LAND ), LOCAL SPORTS 2).

To be in touch with water, we must above all be able to
swim; and to swim daily, the pools and ponds and holes
for swimming must be so widely scattered through the
city, that each person can reach one within minutes.
We have already explained, in POOLS AND STREAMS  4), how
important it is to be in touch with water-and how the ordinary
water of an area can, if left open, be a natural component of the
everyday ecology of a community.
In this pattern we go a little further, and put the emphasis on
swimming. On the one hand, adults cannot have any substantial
contact with water unless they can swim in it, and for this purpose
the body of water must be large enough and deep enough to swim
in. On the other hand, the highly chlorinated, private, walled,
and fenced off swimming pools, which have become common in
rich people's suburbs, work directly against the very forces we
have described in POOLS AND STREAMS 4), and make the touch
of water almost meaningless, because it is so private and so antiseptic.
We believe that the swimming cannot come into its proper
place, unless everyone who wants to can swim every day: and this
means, that, to all intents and purposes, there needs to be a
swimming pool on every block, almost in every cluster, and at
least in every neighborhood, within no more than about I oo yards
of every house.
In this pattern, we shall therefore try to establish a model for a
kind of "swimming hole": public, so that it becomes a communal

TOWNS
function, not a wholly private one; and safe, so that this public
water can be deep enough for swimming without being dangerous
to tiny children playing at the edge.
For millions of years, children have grown up in perfect safety
along the edge of oceans, rivers, and lakes. Why is a swimming
pool so dangerous? The answer depends simply on the edge .
. . . the edge
As a rule, the natural edges between water and shore are
marked by a slow, rough transition. There is a certain well-marked
sequence of changes in materials, texture, and ecology as one
passes from land to water. The human consequences of this transition
are important: it means that people can walk lazily along the
edge, without concern for their safety; they can sit at the edge
and have their feet in the water, or walk along with the water
around their ankles.
Children can play in the water safely when the edge is gradual.
A baby crawling into a lake comes to no abrupt surprises; he stops
when the water gets too deep, and goes back out again. It has
even been shown that thildren teach themselves to swim when
they are free to play around a pool with an extremely gradual
slope toward the deep. In such a pool, some children have even
learned to swim before they can walk. Even the rocks at the
steep edge of a rock-bound lake are not that surprising-because
the sandy earth further from the edge gives way to rocks, which
change their angle and their texture, as one comes to the sharp
edge.
But a swimming pool, and any kind of water with a hard and
artificial edge, has none of this gradualness. A child may be run7
I STILL WATER
ning along, at top speed, when splash, suddenly he finds himself
in six feet of water.
The abrupt edge, most serious for children, has its effects in
psychological terms for adults too. Although they are not literally
endangered by the edge----since they can learn its dangers-the
presence of an ecologically wrong kind of abruptness is disconcerting-
and destroys the peace and calm which water often has.
It is therefore essential that every water's edge, whether on a
pond, or lake, or swimming pool, or river, or canal, be made so
that it has a natural gradient, which changes as a person comes
up to the edge, and goes on changing as the water is first very
shallow, and then gradually gets deeper.
Of course, some deep water is essential for swimming; but the
edge of the deep water must not be directly accessible. Instead,
the edge around the deep end needs to be protected by a wall or
a fence; and islands can be built there, for people to swim to, and
to dive from.
Therefore:
In every neighborhood, provide some still water-a pond,
a pool-for swimming. Keep the pool open to the public at
all times, but make the entrance to the pool only from the
shallow side of the pool, and make the pool deepen gradually,
starting from one or two inches deep.

running water, so that it purifies itself, and does not have to be

 LOCAL SPORTS*
. . • all the areas where people live and work-especially the
WORK COMMUNITIES 1 and the areas looked after by the
preventive programs of the HEALTH CENTER )-need to be
completed by provisions for sports and exercise. This pattern
defines the nature and distribution of this exercise.
The human body does not wear out with use. On the
contrary, it wears down when it is not used.
In agricultural society, people use their bodies every day in
many different ways. In urban society, most people use their
minds, but not their bodies; or they use their bodies only in a
routine way. This is devastating. There is ample empirical evidence
that physical health depends on daily physical activity.
Perhaps the most striking evidence for the unbalance in our
way of life comes from a comparison of the death rates between
groups that have been able to live lives that include daily physical
activity with those that have not. For example, in the age
group  to 4, I per cent of the men in the heavy exercise category
died during the follow-up year, whereas  per cent of those
in the no-exercise group died. See P. B. Johnson et al., Physical
Education, A Problem Solving Approach to Health and Fitness,
University of Toledo, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 66.)
There are very few modern societies where these facts are
taken seriously. China and Cuba come to mind. In these societies,
people work both with their hands and with their minds. Workdays
embrace both kinds of skills. Doctors are as apt to be
building houses as practicing medicine; and builders are often
sitting in administrative sessions.
In any society which has reached this stage, the gross physical
atrophy of human bodies will not occur. But in any society which
has not learned this wisdom, it is necessary, as a kind of interim
solution, to scatter opportunities for physical activity, so that
they are close at hand, indeed next door, to every house and
place of work. Small fields, swimming pools, gyms, game courts,
must be as frequent as corner groceries and restaurants. Ideally,

supported by the people who use them, perhaps coordinated with
a program of health prevention like the swimming and dancing

Sports also have a special life of their own, which cannot be
duplicated. Throwing the ball around, shouting out, winning a
crushing victory, losing a long drawn out n13tch, getting a wild
ball back on the net somehow, anyhow-these arc moments that
cannot be captured by a job of work. They arc entirely different;
perhaps they cater especially to what E. Hart calls the psychoemotional
component of muscular activity. "The Need for Physical
Activity," in S. Maltz, ed., Health Readings, Wm. Brown

vitality that cannot be replaced.

  ADVENTURE
PLAYGROUND
... inside the local neighborhood, even if there is common land
where children can meet and play-coMMON LAND  ), CONNECTED
PLAY ); it is essential that there be at least one
smaller part, which is differentiated, where the play is wilder,
and where the children have access to all kinds of junk.

A castle, made of cartons, rocks, and old branches, by a
group of children for themselves, is worth a thousand perfectly
detailed, exactly finished castles, made for them in
a factory.
Play has many functions: it gives children a chance to be together,
a chance to use their bodies, to build muscles, and to test
new skills. But above all, play is a function of the imagination.
A child's play is his way of dealing with the issues of his growth,
of relieving tensions and exploring the future. It reflects directly
the problems and joys of his social reality. Children come to
terms with the world, wrestle with their pictures of it, and reform
these pictures constantly, through those adventures of
imagination we call play.
Any kind of playground which disturbs, or reduces, the role
of imagination and makes the child more passive, more the
recipient of someone else's imagination, may look nice, may be
clean, may be safe, may be healthy-but it just cannot satisfy the
fundamental need which play is all about. And, to put it bluntly,
it is a waste of time and money. Huge abstract sculptured playlands
are just as bad as asphalt playgrounds and jungle gyms.
They are not just sterile; they are useless. The functions they
perform have nothing to do with the child's most basic needs.
This need for adventurous and imaginative play is taken care
of handily in small towns and in the countryside, where children
have access to raw materials, space, and a somewhat comprehensible
environment. In cities, however, it has become a pressing concern.
The world of private toys and asphalt playgrounds does not
provide the proper settings for this kind of play.
The basic work on this problem has come from Lady Allen of
 ADVENTURE PLAYGROUND
No playing.
Hurtwood. In a series of projects and publications over the past
twenty years, Lady Allen has developed the concept of the
adventure playground for cities, and we refer the reader, above
all, to her work. See, for example, her book, Planning for Play,
Cambridge: MIT Press, 68. We believe that her work is so
substantial, that, by itself, it establishes the essential pattern for
neighborhood playgrounds.
Colin Ward has also written an excellent review, "Adventure
Playgrounds: A Parable of Anarchy," Anarchy , September 61.
Here is a description of the Grimsby playground, from that
review:
At the end of each summer the children saw up their shacks and
shanties into firewood which they deliver in fantastic quantities to
old age pensioners. When they begin building in the spring, "it's
just a hole in the ground-and they crawl into it." Gradually the
holes give way to two-storey huts. Similarly with the notices above
their dens. It begins with nailing up "Keep Out" signs. After this
come more personal names like "Bughold Cave" and "Dead Man's
Cave," but by the end of the summer they have communal names like
"Hospital" or "Estate Agent." There is an everchanging range of
activities due entirely to the imagination and enterprise of the children
themselves.
Therefore:
Set up a playground for the children in each neighborhood.
Not a highly finished playground, with asphalt and
swings, but a place with raw materials of all kinds-nets,
boxes, barrels, trees, ropes, simple tools, frames, grass, and
water-where children can create and re-create playgrounds
of their own.

 ANIMALS

... even when there is public land and private land for individual
buildings-COMMON LAND ), YOUR OWN HOME ),
there is no guarantee that animals can flourish there. This pattern
helps to form GREEN STREETS s  and COMMON LAND  by
giving them the qualities they need to sustain animal life.

Animals are as important a part of nature as the trees
and grass and flowers. There is some evidence, in addition,
which suggests that contact with animals may play a vital
role in a child's emotional development.
Yet while it is widely accepted that we need "parks"-at
least access to some kind of open space where trees and grass and
flowers grow-we do not yet have the same kind of wisdom where
sheep, horses, cows, goats, birds, snakes, rabbits, deer, chickens,
wildcats, gulls, otters, crabs, fish, frogs, beetles, butterflies, and
ants are concerned.
Ann Dreyfus, a family therapist in California, has told us
about the way that animals like goats and rabbits help children
in their therapy. She finds that children who cannot make contact
with people, are nevertheless able to establish contact with these
animals. Once this has happened and feelings have started to flow
again, the children's capacity for making contact starts to grow
again, and eventually spreads out to family and friends.
But animals are almost missing from cities. In a city there are,
broadly speaking, only three kinds of animal: pets, vermin, and
animals in the zoo. None of these three provides the emotional
sustenance nor the ecological connections that are needed. Pets
are pleasant, but so humanized that they have no wild free life
of their own. And they give human beings little opportunity to
experience the animalness of animals. Vermin-rats, cockroaches
-are animals which are peculiar to cities and which depend
ecologically on miserable and disorganized conditions, so they are
naturally considered as enemies. Animals in the zoo are more or
less inaccessible to most of the human population-except as

 ANIMALS
occasional curiosities. Besides, it has been said that animals living
under the conditions which a zoo provides are essentially psychotic
-that is, entirely disturbed from their usual mode of existenceso
that it is probably wrong to keep them there-and certainly
they can in no way re-create the missing web of animal life which
cities need.
Looking in or looking out--w/,at's the cli/lerence?
It is perfectly possible to reintroduce animals into the natural
ecology of cities in a useful and functioning sense, provided that
arrangements are made which allow this and do not create a
nuisance.
Examples of ecologically useful animals in a city: horses, ponies,
donkeys-for local transportation and sport. Pigs-to recycle
garbage and for meat. Ducks and chickens-as a source of eggs
and meat. Cows-for milk. Goats-milk. Bees-honey and pollination
of fruit trees. Birds-to maintain insect balance.
There are essentially two difficulties to overcome. I Many of
these animals have been driven out of cities by law because they
interrupt traffic, leave dung on the street, and carry disease.  )
Many of the animals cannot survive without protection under
modern urban conditions. It is necessary to make specific provisions
to overcome these difficulties.
Therefore:
Make legal prov1S1ons which allow people to keep any
animals on their private lots or in private stables. Create a
piece of fenced and protected common land, where animals

TOWNS
are free to graze, with grass, trees, and water in it. Make at

keep a working community alive-HOUSING IN BETWEEN ).
This next pattern now gives you some vital information about the
social character of the household itself. If you succeed in following
this pattern, it will help repair LIFE CYCLE   and HOUSEHOLD
MIX  in your community.
The nuclear family is not by itself a viable social form.
Until a few years ago, human society was based on the extended
family: a family of at least three generations, with
parents, children, grandparents, uncles, aunts, and cousins, all
living together in a single or loosely knit multiple household.
But today people move hundreds of miles to marry, to find
education, and to work. Under these circumstances the only
family units which are left are those units called nuclear families:
father, mother, and children. And many of these are broken
down even further by divorce and separation.
Unfortunately, it seems very likely that the nuclear family is
not a viable social form. It is too small. Each person in a nuclear
family is too tightly linked to other members of the family; any
one relationship which goes sour, even for a few hours, becomes
critical; people cannot simply turn away toward uncles, aunts,
grandchildren, cousins, brothers. Instead, each difficulty twists
the family unit into ever tighter spirals of discomfort; the
children become prey to all kinds of dependencies and oedipal
neuroses; the parents are so dependent on each other that they
are finally forced to separate.
Philip Slater describes this situation for American families and
finds in the adults of the family, especially the women, a terrible,
brooding sense of deprivation. There are simply not enough
people around, not enough communal action, to give the ordinary

TOWNS
experience around the home any depth or richness. Philip E.
Slater, The Pursuit of Loneline,s, Boston: Beacon Press, 70,
p. , and throughout.)
It seems essential that the people in a household have at least
a dozen people round them, so that they can find the comfort
and relationships they need to sustain the during their ups and
downs. Since the old extended family, based on blood ties, seems
to be gone-at least for the moment-this can only happen if
small families, couples, and single people join together in voluntary
"families" of ten or so.
In his final book, Island, Aldous Huxley portrayed a lovely
vision of such a development:
"How many homes does a Palanese child have?"
"About twenty on the average."
"Twenty? My God!"
"We all belong," Susila explaine<l, "to a MAC-a Mutual Adoption
Club. Every MAC consists of anything from fifteen to twentyfive
assorted couples. Newly elected brides and bridegrooms, oldtimers
with growing children, grandparents and great-grandparentseverybody
in the club adopts everyone else. Besides our own blood relations,
we all have our quota of deputy mothers, deputy fathers,
deputy aunts and uncles, deputy brothers and sisters, deputy babies
and toddlers and teen-agers."
Will shook his head. "Making twenty families grow where only
one grew before."
"But what grew before was your kind of family .... " As though
reading instructions from a cookery book, "Take one sexually inept
wage slave," she went on, "one dissatisfied female, two or if preferred)
three small television addicts; marinate in a mixture of
Freudism and dilute Christianity; then bottle up tightly in a fourroom
flat and stew for fifteen years in their own juice. Our recipe is
rather different: Take twenty sexually satisfied couples and their
offspring; add science, intuition and humor in equal quantities;
steep in Tantrik Buddhism and simmer indefinitely in an open pan
in the open air over a brisk flame of affection."
"And what comes out of your open pan?" he asked.
"An entirely different kind of family. Not exclusive, like your
families, and not predestined, not compulsory. An inclusive, unpredestined
and voluntary family. Twenty pairs of fathers and mothers,
eight or nine ex-fathers and ex-mothers, and forty or fifty assorted
children of all ages." Aldous Huxley, Island, New York: Bantam,
1962, pp. -90.)
Physically, the setting for a large voluntary family must provide
 THE FAMILY
for a balance of privacy and communality. Each small family,
each person, each couple, needs a private realm, almost a private
household of their own, according to their territorial need. In
the movement to build communes, it is our experience that
groups have not taken this need for privacy seriously enough. It
has been shrugged off, as something to overcome. But it is a
deep and basic need; and if the setting does not let each
person and each small household regulate itself on this dimension,
it is sure to cause trouble. We propose, therefore, that individuals,
couples, people young and old-each subgroup-have its own
legally independent household-in some cases, physically separate
households and cottages, at least separate room , suites, and
floors.
The private realms are then set off against the common space
and the common functions. The most vital commons are the
kitchen, the place to sit down and eat, and a garden. Common
meals, at least several nights a week, seem to play the biggest
role in binding the group. The meals, and taking time at the
cooking, provide the kind of casual meeting time when everything
else can be comfortably discussed: the child care arrangements,
maintenance, projects-see COMMUNAL EATING ).
This would suggest, then, a large family room-farmhouse kitchen,
right at the heart of the site-at the main crossroads, where
everyone would tend to meet toward the end of the day. Again,
according to the style of the family, this might be a separate
building, with workshop and gardens, or one wing of a house,
or the entire first floor of a two or three story building.
There is some evidence that processes which generate large
voluntary group households are already working in the society.
(Cf. Pamela Hollie, "More families share houses with others to

One way to spur the growth of voluntary families: When someone
turns over or sells their home or room or apartment, they
first tell everyone living around them-their neighbors. These
neighbors then have the right to find friends of theirs to take
the place-and thus to extend their "family." If friends are able
to move in, then they can arrange for themselves how to create a
functioning family, with commons, and so on. They might
build a connection between the homes, knock out a wall, add a

Therefore:
Set up processes which encourage groups of  to
people to come together and establish communal households.
Morphologically, the important things are:
 Private realms for the groups and individuals that
make up the extended family: couple's realms, private
rooms, sub-households for small families.
 Common space for shared functions: cooking, working,
gardening, child care.

Each individual household within the larger family must, at
all costs, have a clearly defined territory of its own, which it
controls-YOUR OWN HOME ); treat the individual territories
according to the nature of the individual households-HOUSE FOR
A SMALL FAMILY 6), HOUSE FOR A COUPLE 7), HOUSE FOR
ONE PERSON ); and build common space between them,
where the members of the different smaller households can meet
and eat together-COMMON AREAS AT THE HEART  I )' COMMUNAL

 HOUSE FOR A SMALL
FAMILY*
... according to THE FAMILY 5), each nuclear family ought
to be a member household of a larger group household. If this is
not possible, do what you can, when building a house for a
small family, to generate some larger, possible group household,
by tying it together with the next door households; in any case,
at the very least, form the begin11ing of a HOUSE CLUSTER  ).
In a house for a small family, it is the relationship between
children and adults which is most critical.
Many small households, not large enough to have a full fledged
nursery, not rich enough to have a nanny, find themselves
swamped by the children. The children naturally want to be
where the adults are; their parents don't have the heart, or the
energy, to keep them out of special areas; so finally the whole
house has the character of a children's room-children's clothes,
drawings, boots and shoes, tricycles, toy trucks, and disarray.
Yet, obviously few parents feel happy to give up the calm and
cleanliness and quiet of the adult world in every square inch of
their homes. To help achieve a balance, a house for a small family
needs three distinct areas: a couple's realm, reserved for the
adults; a children's realm, where children's needs hold sway; and
a common area, between the two, connected to them both.
The couple's realm should be more than a room, although
rooms are a part of it. It is territory which sustains them as two
adults, a couple-not father and mother. Other parts of their
lives are involved with children, friends, work; there must be a
place which becomes naturally an expression of them as adults,
alone. The children come in and out of this territory, but when
they are there, they are clearly in the adults' world. See COUPLE'S
REALM ).
The children's world must also be looked upon as territory
that they share, as children, CHILDREN's REALM  I  ); here, it
is important to establish that this is a part of the house, in balance
with the others. Again, the critical feature is not that adults are
 HOUSE FOR A SMALL FAMILY
"excluded" but that, when they are in this world, they are m
children's territory.
The common area contains those functions that the children
and the adults share: eating together, sitting together, games, perhaps
bathing, gardening-again, whatever captures their needs
for shared territory. Quite likely, the common territory will be
larger than the two other parts of the house.
Finally, realize that this pattern is different from the way most
small family homes are made today. For example, a popular current
conception, comparable to this, but quite different, is a
suburban two part howe: sleeping and commons.
A typical suburban two part house.
Even though there is a "master bedroom" the sleeping part
of the house is essentially one thing-the children are all around
the master bedroom. This plan does not have the distinctions we
are arguing for.
Here is a beautiful plan which does:
A three-part house-t!te couple's realm upstairs.
TOWNS
Therefore:
Give the house three distinct parts: a realm for parents,
a realm for the children, and a common area. Conceive
these three realms as roughly similar in size, with the commons
the largest.
parents' realm
children's realm

Treat the house, like every house, as a distinct piece of territory

CHILDREN'S REALM ). , , ,
 HOUSE FOR A COUPLE*
... again, ideally, every couple is a part of a larger group household-
THE FAMILY   ). If th is can not be so, try to build the
house for the couple in such a way as to tie it together with some
other households, to form the beginnings of a group household,
or, if this fails, at least to form the beginnings of a HOUSE CLUSTER
(   ·

In a small household shared by two, the most important
problem which arises is the possibility that each may have
too little opportunity for solitude or privacy.
Consider these forces:
I. Of course, the couple need a shared realm, where they can
function together, invite friends, be alone together. This realm
needs to be made up of functions which they share.
 But it is also true that each partner is trying to maintain
an individuality, and not be submerged in the identity of the
other, or the identity of the "couple." Each partner needs space
to nourish this need.
It is essential, therefore, that a small house be conceived as a
place where the two people may be together but where, from
time to time, either one of them may also be alone, in comfort,
in dignity, and in such a way that the other does not feel left
out or isolated. To this end, there must be two small placesperhaps
rooms, perhaps large alcoves, perhaps a corner, screened
off by a half-wall-places which are clearly understood as private
territories, where each person can keep to himself, pursue his
or her own activities.
Still, the problem of the balance of privacy in a couple's lives
is delicate. Even with a small place of one's own, tenuously connected
to the house, one partner may feel left out at various
moments. While we believe that the solution proposed in this
pattern helps, the problem will not be entirely settled until the
couple itself is in some close, neighborly, and family-like rela77
HOUSE FOR A COUPLE
tionship to other adults. Then, when one needs privacy, the other
has other possibilities for companionship at hand. This idea and
its physical implications are discussed in the pattern, THE FAMILY
(   ·
Once the opportunity for withdrawal is satisfied, there is also
a genuine opportunity for the couple to be together; and then
the house can be a place where genuine intimacy, genuine connection
can happen.
There is one other problem, unique to a house for a couple,
that must be mentioned. In the first years of a couple's life, as
they learn more about each other, and find out if indeed they
have a future together, the evolution of the house plays a vital
role. Improving the house, fixing it up, enlarging it, provides a
frame for learning about one another: it brings out conflict, and
offers the chance, like almost no other activity, for concrete resolution
and growth. This suggests that a couple find a place that
they can change gradually over the years, and not build or buy for
themselves a "dream" home from scratch. The experience of
making simple changes in the house, and tuning it to their lives,
provides some grist for their own growth. Therefore, it is best to
start small, with plenty of room for growth and change.
Therefore:
Conceive a house for a couple as being made up of two
kinds of places-a shared couple's realm and individual
private worlds. Imagine the shared realm as half-public
and half-intimate; and the private worlds as entirely individual
and private.
shared couple's realm
TOWNS

Again, treat the house as a distinct piece of territory, m some
fashion owned by its users-YOUR OWN HOME  ). Lay out the
common part, according to the pattern COUPLE'S REALM  I ),
and give both persons an individual world of their own where
they can be alone-A ROOM OF oNE's OWN  1 . ...
 HOUSE FOR ONE PERSON*
... the households with one person in them, more than any
other, need to be a part of some kind of larger household-THE
FAMILY   ). Either build them to fit into some larger group
household, or even attach them, as ancillary cottages to other,
ordinary family households like HOUSE FOR A SMALL FAMILY 6)
or HOUSE FOR A COUPLE  7).
Once a household for one person is part of some larger
group, the most critical problem which arises is the need
for simplicity.
The housing market contains few houses or apartments specifically
built for one person. Most often men and women who
choose to live alone, live in larger houses and apartments, originally
built for two people or families. And yet for one person
these larger places are most often uncom pact, unwieldy, hard to
live in, hard to look after. Most important of all, they do not
allow a person to develop a sense of self-sufficiency, simplicity,
compactness, and economy in his or her own life.
The kind of place which is most closely suited to one person's
needs, and most nearly overcomes this problem, is a place of the
utmost simplicity, in which only the bare bones of necessity are
there: a place, built like a ploughshare, where every corner, every
table, every shelf, each flower pot, each chair, each log, is placed
according to the simplest necessity, and supports the person's
life directly, plainly, with the harmony of nothing that is not
needed, and everything that is.
The plan of such a house will be characteristically different
from other houses, primarily because it requires almost no differentiation
of its spaces: it need only be one room. It can be a
cottage or a studio, built on the ground or in a larger building,
part of a group household or a detached structure. In essence, it
is simply a central space, with nooks around it. The nooks replace
the rooms in a larger house; they are for bed, bath, kitchen,
workshop and entrance.
It is important to realize that very many of the patterns in
this book can be built into a small house; small size does not pre-
39°
 HOUSE FOR ONE PERSON
elude richness of form. The trick is to intensify and to overlay; to
compress the patterns; to reduce them to simple expressions; to
make every inch count double. When it is well done, a small
house feels wonderfully continuous-cooking a bowl of soup fills
the house; there is no rattling around. This cannot happen if the
place is divided into rooms.
We have found it necessary to call special attention to this
pattern because it is nearly impossible to build a house this small
in cities-there is no way to get hold of a very small lot. Zoning
codes and banking practices prohibit such tiny lots; they prohibit
"normal" lots from splitting down to the kind of scale that a
house for one person requires. The correct development of this
pattern will require a change in these ordinances.
Therefore:
Conceive a house for one person as a place of the utmost
simplicity: essentially a one-room cottage or studio, with
large and small alcoves around it. When it is most intense,
the entire house may be no more than  to  square
feet.
alcoves

And again, make the house an individual piece of territory,
with its own garden, no matter how small-YOUR OWN HOME
( ); make the main room essentially a kind of farmhouse kitchen
-FARMHOUSE KITCHEN ), with alcoves opening off it for
sitting, working, bathing, sleeping, dressing-BATHING ROOM
(144), WINDOW PLACE 0), WORKSPACE ENCLOSURE 3),
BED ALCOVE 8), DRESSING ROOM ); if the house is meant
for an old person, or for someone very young, shape it also according
to the pattern for OLD AGE COTTAGE  r   or TEENAGER'S
COTTAGE  I  ), . . ,

 YOUR OWN HOME,**

... according to THE FAMILY   ), each individual household
should be a part of a larger family group household. Whether this
is so, or not, each individual household, must also have a territory
of its own which it controls completely-HousE FOR A SMALL
FAMILY 6), HOUSE FOR A COUPLE 7), HOUSE FOR ONE
PERSON ); this pattern, which simply sets down the need for
such a territory, helps especiaUy to form higher density house
clusters like ROWH OUSES( ), HOUSINGH ILL ), which often
do not have well-defined individual territories for the separate
households.

People cannot be genuinely comfortable and healthy in
a house which is not theirs. All forms of rental-whether
from private landlords or public housing agencies-work
against the natural processes which allow people to form
stable, self-healing communities.
Income property.
in the imperishable primal language of the human heart house
means my house, your house, a man's own house. The house is the
winning throw of the dice which man has wrested from the uncanniness
of uni verse; it is his defense against the chaos that threatens to
invade him. Therefore his deeper wish is that it be his own house,
that he not have to share with anyone other than his own family.
(Martin Buber, A Believing Humanism: Gleanings, New York:
Simon and Shuster, 69, p. )
This pattern is not intended as an argument in favor of "private

TOWNS
property," or the process of buying and selling land. Indeed, it
is very clear that all those processes which encourage speculation
in land, for the sake of profit, are unhealthy and destructive, because
they invite people to treat houses as commodities, to build
things for "resale," and not in such a way as to fit their own
needs.
And just as speculation and the profit motive make it impossible
for people to adapt their houses to their own needs, so
tenancy, rental, and landlords do the same. Rental areas are always
the first to turn to slums. The mechanism is clear and well known.
See, for example, George Sternlieb, The Tenement Landlord
(Rutgers University Press, 66). The landlord tries to keep his
maintenance and repair costs as low as possible; the residents
have no incentive to maintain and repair the homes-in fact, the
opposite-since improvements add to the wealth of the landlord,
and even justify higher rent. And so the typical piece of rental
property degenerates over the years. Then landlords try to build
new rental properties which are immune to neglect-gardens are
replaced with concrete, carpets are replaced with lineoleum, and
wooden surfaces by formica: it is an attempt to make the new
units maintenance-free, and to stop the slums by force; but they
turn out cold and sterile and again turn into slums, because nobody
loves them.
People will only be able to feel comfortable in their houses,
if they can change their houses to suit themselves, add on whatever
they need, rearrange the garden as they like it; and, of
course, they can only do this in circumstances where they are
the legal owners of the house and land; and if, in high density
multi-story housing, each apartment, like a house, has a welldefined
volume, in which the owner can make changes as he likes.
This requires then, that every house is owned-in some fashion
-by the people that live in it; it requires that every house,
whether at ground level or in the air, has a well-defined volume
within which the family is free to make whatever changes they
want; and it requires a form of ownership which discourages
speculation.
Several approaches have been put forward in recent years to
solve the problem of providing each household with a "home."

 YOUR OWN HOME
At one extreme there are ideas like Habraken's high density
"support" system, where families buy pads on publicly owned
superstructures and gradually develop their own homes. And at
the other extreme there are the rural communes, where people
have forsaken the city to create their own homes in the country.
Even modified forms of rental can help the situation if they
allow people to change their houses according to their needs
and give people some financial stake in the process of maintenance.
This helps, because renting is often a step along the way to home
ownership; but unless tenants can somehow recover their investments
in money and labor, the hopeless cycle of degeneration
of rental property and the degeneration of the tenants' financial
capability will continue. Cf. Rolf Goetze, "Urban Housing Rehabilitation,"
in Turner and Fichter, eds., The Freedom to
Build, New York: Macmillan, 72.)
A common element in all these cases is the understanding that
the successful development of a household's "home" depends upon
these features: Each household must possess a clearly defined site
for both a house and an outdoor space, and the household must
own this site in the sense that they are in full control of its development.
Therefore:
Do everything possible to make the traditional forms of
rental impossible, indeed, illegal. Give every household its
own home, with space enough for a garden. Keep the
emphasis in the definition of ownership on control, not on
financial ownership. Indeed, where it is possible to construct
forms of ownership which give people control over
their houses and gardens, but make financial speculation
impossible, choose these forms above all others. In all
cases give people the legal power, and the physical opportunity
to modify and repair their own places. Pay attention
to this rule especially, in the case of high density apartments:
build the apartments in such a way that every individual
apartment has a garden, or a terrace where vegetables
will grow, and that even in this situation, each family

can build, and change, and add on to their house as they
wish.

For the shape of the house, begin with BUILDING COMPLEX
(  ). For the shape of the lot, do not accept the common notion
of a lot which has a narrow frontage and a great deal of depth.
Instead, try to make every house lot roughly square, or even long
along the street and shallow. All this is necessary to create the
right relation between house and garden-HALF-HIDDEN GARDEN

 SELF-GOVERNING
WORKSHOPS AND OFFICES**
... all kinds of work, office work and industrial work and agricultural
work, are radically decentralized by SCATTERED WORK
(9), and INDUSTRIAL RIBBONS 2 and grouped in small communities-
woRK coMMUNITY  1). This pattern helps to generate
these larger patterns by giving the fundamental nature of
all work organizations, no matter what their type.
No one enjoys his work if he is a cog in a machine.
A man enjoys his work when he understands the whole and
when he is responsible for the quality of the whole. He can only
understand the whole and be responsible for the whole when
the work which happens in society, all of it, is undertaken by
small self-governing human groups; groups small enough to give
people understanding through face-to-face contact, and autonomous
enough to let the workers themselves govern their own
affairs.
The evidence for this pattern is built upon a single, fundamental
proposition: work is a form of living, with its own intrinsic
rewards; any way of organizing work which is at odds
with this idea, which treats work instrumentally, as a means only
to other ends, is inhuman. Down through the ages people have
described and proposed ways of working according to this
proposition. Recently, E. F. Schumacher, the economist, has
made a beautiful statement of this attitude E. F. Schumacher,
"Buddhist Economics," Resurgence,  Kings Road, Kingston,
Surrey, Volumel,Number 1,January, 68).
The Buddhist point of view takes the function of work to be at
least threefold: to give a man a chance to utilize and develop his
faculties; to enable him to overcome his ego-centcredness by joining
with other people in a common task; and to bring forth the goods
and services needed for a becoming existence. Again, the consequences
that flow from this view are endless. To organize work in such a
manner that it becomes meaningless, boring, stultifying, or nerveracking
for the worker would be little short of criminal; it would
indicate a greater concern with goods than with people, an evil lack
of compassion and a soul-destroying degree of attachment to the most

TOWNS
primitive side of this worldly existence. Equally, to strive for leisure
as an alternative to work would be considered a complete misunderstanding
of one of the basic truths of human existence, namely, that
work and leisure are complementary parts of the same living process
and cannot be separated without destroying the joy of work and the
bliss of leisure.
From the Buddhist point of view, there are therefore two types
of mechanization which must be clearly distinguished: one that enhances
a man's skill and power and one that turns the work of man
over to a mechanical slave, leaving man in a position of having to
serve the slave. How to tell the one from the other? "The craftsman
himself," says Ananda Coomaraswamy, a man equally competent
to talk about the Modern West as the Ancient East, "the craftsman
himself can always, if allowed to, draw the delicate distinction
between the machine and the tool. The carpet loom is a tool, a
contrivance for holding warp threads at a stretch for the pile to be
woven round them by the craftsmen's fingers; but the power loom
is a machine, and its significance as a destroyer of culture lies in the
fact that it does the essentially human part of the work." It is
clear, therefore, that Buddhist economics must be very different
from the economics of modern materialism, since the Buddhist sees the
essence of civilization not in a multiplication of wants but in the
purification of human character. Character, at the same time, is
formed primarily by a man's work. And work, properly conducted
in conditions of human dignity and freedom, blesses those who do it
and equally their products. The Indian philosopher and economist
J. C. Kumarappa sums the matter up as follows:
"If the nature of the work is properly appreciated and applied, it
will stand in the same relation to the higher faculties as food is to the
physical body. It nourishes and enlivens the higher man and urges
him to produce the best he is capable of. It directs his freewill along
the proper course and disciplines the animal in him into progressive
channels. It furnishes an excellent background for man to display his
scale of values and develop his personality."
In contrast to this form of work stands the style of work that
has been created by the technological progress of the past two
hundred years. In this style workers are made to operate like parts
of a machine; they create parts of no consequence, and have no
responsibility for the whole. We may fairly say that the alienation
of workers from the intrinsic pleasures of their work has
been a primary product of the industrial revolution. The alienation
is particularly acute in large organizations, where faceless
workers repeat endlessly menial tasks to create products and services
with which they cannot identify.
 SELF-GOVERNING WORKSHOPS AND OFFICES
In these organizations, with all the power and benefits that
the unions have been able to wrest from the hands of the owners,
there is still evidence that workers are fundamentally unhappy
with their work. In the auto industry, for example, the absentee
rate on Mondays and Fridays is staggering-I  to  per cent;
and there is evidence of "massive alcoholism, similar to what the
Russians are experiencing with their factory workers" Nicholas
von Hoffman, Washington Post). The fact is that people cannot
find satisfaction in work unless it is performed at a human scale
and in a setting where the worker has a say.
Job dissatisfaction in modern industry has also led to industrial
sabotage and a faster turnover of workers in recent years. A new
super-automated General Motors assembly plant in Lordstown,
Ohio, was sabotaged and shut down for several weeks. Absenteeism
in the three largest automobile manufacturing companies has
doubled in the past seven years. The turnover of workers has also
doubled. Some industrial engineers believe that "American industry
in some cases may have pushed technology too far by taking
the last few bits of skill out of jobs, and that a point of human
resistance has been reached" Agis Salpukis, "ls the machine pushing
man over the brink?" San Francisco Sunday Examiner and
Chronicle, April , 72).
Perhaps the most dramatic empirical evidence for the connection
between work and life is that presented in the recent study,
"Work in America," commissioned by Elliot Richardson, as Secretary
of Health, Education and Welfare Department,  . This
study finds that the single best predictor of long life is not
whether a person smokes or how of ten he sees a doctor, but the
extent to which he is satisfierl with his job. The report identifies
the two main elements of job dissatisfaction as the diminishing
independence of workers, and the increasing simplification, fragmentation,
and isolation of tasks-both of which are rampant in
modern industrial and office work alike.
But for most of human history, the production of goods and
services was for a far more personal, self-regulating affair; when
each job of work was a matter of creative interest. And there is
no reason why work can't be like that again, today.
For instance, Seymour Melman, in Decision Making and Productivity,
compares the manufacture of tractors in Detroit and in

TOWNS
Coventry, England. He contrasts Detroit's managerial rule with
Coventry's gang system and shows that the gang system produced
high quality products and the highest wages in British industry.
"The most characteristic feature of the decision-formulation
process is that of mutuality in decision-making with final
authority residing in the hands of the group workers themselves."
Other projects and experiments and evidence which indicate
that modern work can be organized in this manner and still be
compatible with sophisticated technology, have been collected by
Hunnius, Garson, and Chase. See Workers' Control, New York:
Vintage Books, 73.
And another example comes from the reports by E. L. Trist,
Organizational Choice and P. Herbst, Autonomous Group Functioning.
These authors describe the organization of work in mining
pits in Durham which was put into practice by groups of
mmers.
The composite work organization may be described as one in which
the group takes over complete responsibility for the total cycle of
operations involved in mining the coal-face. No member of the
group has a fixed work-role. Instead, the men deploy themselves, depending
on the requirements of the ongoing group task. Within
the limits of technological and safety requirements they are free to
evolve their way of organizing and carrying out their task.
[The experiment demonstrates] the ability of quite large primary
work groups of 0- members to act as self-regulating, selfdeveloping
social organisms able to maintain .themselves in a steady
state of high productivity. Quoted in Colin Ward, "The organization
of anarchy," Patterns of /narchy, Krimerman and Perry, eds.,
New York: Anchor Books, 66, pp. -51.)
We believe that these small self-governing groups are not only
most efficient, but also the only possible source of job satisfaction.
They provide the only style of work that is nourishing and intrinsically
satisfying.
Therefore:
Encourage the formation of self-governing workshops
and offices of  to  workers. Make each group autonomous-

... all offices which provide service to the public-WORK COMMUNITY
(41), UNIVERSITY AS A MARKETPLACE 3), LOCAL TOWN
HALL 4), HEATH CENTER ), TEENAGE SOCIETY 4 need
subsidiary departments, where the members of the public go. And
of course, piecemeal development of these small departments, one
department at a time, can also help to generate these larger patterns
gradually.
Departments and public services don't work if they are
too large. When they are large, their human qualities
vanish; they become bureaucratic; red tape takes over.
There is a great deal of literature on the way red tape and
bureaucracy work against human needs. See, for example, Gideon
Sjoberg, Richard Brymer, and Buford Farris, "Bureaucracy and
the Lower Class," Sociology and Social Research, 0, April, I 66,
pp.  -77; and Alvin W. Gouldner, "Red Tape as a Social
Problem," in Robert Mertin, Reader in Bureaucracy, Free Press,
1952, pp. -18.
According to these authors, red tape can be overcome in two
ways. First, it can be overcome by making each service program
small and autonomous. A great deal of evidence shows that red
tape occurs largely as a result of impersonal relationships in
large institutions. When people on no longer communicate on a
face-to-face basis, they need formal regulations, and in the lower
echelons of the organization, these formal regulations are followed
blindly and narrowly.
Second, red tape can be overcome by changing the passive
nature of the clients' relation to service programs. There is considerable
evidence to show that when clients have an active
relationship with a social institution, the institution loses its power
to intimidate them.
We have therefore concluded that no service should have
more than  persons total all staff, including clerks). We base
this figure on the fact that I  seems to be the largest number of
TOWNS
people that can sit down in a face-to-face discussion. It seems
likely that a smaller staff size will work better still. Furthermore,
each service should be relatively autonomous-subject only to a
few simple, coordinative regulations from parent organizationsand
that this should be emphasized by physical autonomy. In
order to be physically autonomous, each service must have an
area which is entirely under its own jurisdiction; with its own
door on a public thoroughfare, and complete physical separation
from other services.
This pattern applies equally to the departments of a city hall,
a medical center, or to the local branches of a welfare agency. In
most of these cases the pattern would require basic changes m
administrative organization. However difficult they may be to
implement, we believe these changes are required.
Therefore:
In any institution whose departments provide public
service:
 Make each service or department autonomous as far as
possible.
 Allow no one service more than  staff members
total.
 House each one in an identifiable piece of the building.
 Give each one direct access to a public thoroughfare.

in any work community or any office, there are always

each other, which ones further apart? This pattern gives the
answer to this question, and in doing so, helps greatly to construct
the inner layout of a WORK COMMUNITY 1 or of SELF-GOVERNING
WORKSHOPS AND OFFICES 0 or of SMALL SERVICES WITHOUT
RED TAPE 1).

If two parts of an office are too far apart, people will
not move between them as often as they need to; and if
they are more than one floor apart, there will be almost no
communication between the two.
Current architectural methods often include a proximity
matrix, which shows the amount of movement between different
people and functions in an office or a hospital. These methods
always make the tacit assumption that the functions which have
the most movement between them should be closest together.
However, as usually stated, this concept is completely invalid,
The concept has been created by a kind of Taylorian quest
for efficiency, in which it is assumed that the less people walk
about, the less of their salary is spent on "wasteful" walking. The
logical conclusion of this kind of analysis is that, if it were only
possible, people should not have to walk at all, and should spend
the day vegetating in their armchairs.
The fact is that people work best only when they are healthy
in mind and body. A person who is forced to sit all day long
behind a desk, without ever stretching his legs, will become
restless and unable to work, and inefficient in this way. Some
walking is very good for you. It is not only good for the body,
but also gives people an opportunity for a change of scene, a way

 OFFICE CONNECTIONS
of thinking about something else, a chance to reflect on some
detail of the morning's work or one of the everyday human
problems in the office.
On the other hand, if a person has to make the same trip,
many times, there is a point at which the length of the trip
becomes time-consuming and annoying, and then inefficient, because
it makes the person irritable, and fina1ly critical when a
person starts avoiding trips because they are too long and too
frequent.
An office will function efficiently so long as the people who
work there do not feel that the trips they have to take are a
nuisance_. Trips need to be short enough so they are not felt a
nuisance-but they do not need to be any shorter.
The nuisance of a trip depends on the relationship between
length and frequency. You can walk Io feet to a file many times
a day without being annoyed by it; you can walk  feet
occasionally without being annoyed. In the graph below we plot
the nuisance threshold for various combinations of length and
frequency.
The graph is based on r   observations in the Berkeley City
Hall. People were asked to define all the trips they had to make
regularly during the work week, to state their frequency, and
then to state whether they considered the trip to be a nuisance.
The line on the graph shows the median of the distances said
to be a nuisance for each different frequency. We define distances
to the right of this line as nuisance distances. The nuisance
distance for any trip frequency is the distance at which we
predict that at least  per cent of all people will begin to consider
this distance a nuisance.

So far, our discussion of proximity has been based on horizontal
distances. How do stairs enter in? What part does vertical
distance play in the experience of proximity? Or, to put it more
precisely, what is the horizontal equivalent of one flight of stairs?
Suppose two departments need to be within I oo feet of one
another, according to the proximity graph-and suppose that
they are for some reason on different stories, one floor apart. How
much of the roo feet does the stair eat up: with the stair between
them, how far apart can they be horizontally?
We do not know the exact answer to this question. However,
we do have some indirect evidence from an unpublished study by
Marina Estabrook and Robert Sommer. As we shall see, this
study shows that stairs play a much greater role, and eat up much
more "distance" than you might imagine.
Estabrook and Sommer studied the formation of acquaintances
in a three-story university building, where several different
departments were housed. They asked people to name all the
people they knew in departments other than their own. Their
results were as follows:
Percent of people known:
I .2


When departments are:
on same floor
one floor apart
two floors apart
People knew I . per cent of the people from other departments
on the same floor as their own, . per cent of the people
from other departments one floor apart from their own floor,
and only . per cent of the people from other departments two
floors apart from their own. In short, by the time departments are
separated by two floors or more, there is virtually no informal
contact between the departments.
Unfortunately, our own study of proximity was done before
we knew about these findings by Estabrook and Sommer; so we
have not yet been able to define the relation between the two
kinds of distance, It is clear, though, that one stair must be
equivalent to a rather considerable horizontal distance; and that
two flights of stairs have almost three times the effect of a single
stair. On the basis of this evidence, we conjecture that one stair
is equal to about ! horizontal feet in its effect on interaction

 OFFICE CONNECTIONS
and feelings of distance; and that two flights of stairs are equal
to about  horizontal feet.
Therefore:
To establish distances between departments, calculate the
number of trips per day made between each two departments;
get the "nuisance distance" from the graph above;
then make sure that the physical distance between the two
departments is less than the nuisance distance. Reckon one
flight of stairs as about  feet, and two flights of stairs as
about  feet. .a <wo flooG m,.U,rnm mrnifWt«E  less than nuisance distance

... the NETWORK OF LEARNING   in the community relies
on the fact that learning is decentralized, and part and parcel of
every activity-not just a classroom thing. In order to realize
this pattern, it is essential that the individual workgroups, throughout
industry, offices, workshops, and work communities, are all
set up to make the learning process possible. This pattern, which
shows the arrangement needed, therefore helps greatly to form
SELF-GOVERNING WORKSHOPS AND OFFICES 0 as well as the
NETWORK OF LEARNING ).

The fundamental learning situation is one in which a
person learns by helping someone who really knows what
he is doing.
It is the simplest way of acquiring knowledge, and t s powerfully
effective. By comparison, learning from lectures and books is
dry as dust. But this situation has all but disappeued from modern
society. The schools and universities have taken over and abstracted
many ways of learning which in earlier times were always closely
related to the real work of professionals, tradesmen, artisans, independent
scholars. In the twelfth century, for instance, young
people learned by working beside masters-helping them, making
contact directly with every corner of society. W en a young
person found himself able to contribute to a field of knowledge,
or a trade--he would prepare a master "piece"; and with the
consent of the masters, become a fellow in the guild.
An experiment by Alexander and Goldberg has shown that a
class in which one person teaches a small group of others is most
likely to be successful in those cases where the "students" are
actually helping the "teacher" to do something or solve some
problem, which he is working on anyway-not when a subject of
abstract or general interest is being taught. Report to the
Muscatine Committee, on experimental course ED. 0X, Department
of Architecture, University of California, 66.)
If th is is generally true-in short, if students can learn best
when they are acting as apprentices, and helping to do something
TOWNS
interesting-it follows that our schools and universities and
offices and industries must provide physical settings which make
this master-apprentice relation possible and natural: physical
settings where communal work is centered on the master's efforts
and where half a dozen apprentices-not more-have workspace
closely connected to the communal work of the studio.
We know of an example of this pattern, in the Molecular
Biology building of the University of Oregon. The floors of the
building are made up of laboratories, each one under the direction
of a professor of biology, each with two or three small rooms
opening directly off the lab for graduate students working under
the professor's direction.

We believe that variations of this pattern are possible in many
different work organizations, as well as the schools. The practice
of law, architecture, medicine, the building trades, social services,
engineering-each discipline has the potential to set up its ways
of learning, and therefore the environments in which its practitioners
work, along these lines.
Therefore:
Arrange the work in every workgroup, industry, and
office, in such a way that work and learning go forward
hand in hand. Treat every piece of work as an opportunity
for learning. To this end, organize work around a tradition
of masters and apprentices: and support this form of

 TEEN-AGE SOCIETY
... the balanced LIFE CYCLE   requires that the transition
from childhood to adulthood be treated by a far more subtle and
embracing kind of teenage institution than a school; this
pattern, which begins to define that institution, can take its
place in the NETWORK OF LEARNING    and help contribute to
the network of MASTERS AND APPRENTICES  ).
Teenage is the time of passage between childhood and
adulthood. In traditional societies, this passage is accompanied
by rites which suit the psychological demands of the
transition. But in modern society the "high school" fails entirely
to provide this passage.
The most striking traditional example we know comes from
an east African tribe. In order to become a man, a boy of this
tribe embarks on a two year journey, which includes a series of
more and more difficult tasks, and culminates in the hardest of
all-to kill a lion. During his journey, families and villages all
over the territory which he roams take him in, and care for him:
they recognize their obligation to do so as part of his ritual.
Finally, when the boy has passed through all these tasks, and
killed his lion, he is accepted as a man.
ln modern society, the transition cannot be so direct or simple.
For reasons too complex to discuss here, the process of transition,
and the time it takes have been extended and elaborated greatly.
(See Edgar Friedenberg, The Vanishing A do!e,cent, Beacon Press,
Boston,  and Coming of Age in America, Random House
Inc. N.Y., 65). Teenage lasts, typically, from  to ; six
years instead of one or two. The simple sexual transformation, the
change from childhood to maturity, has given way to a much
vaster, slower change, in which the self of a person emerges
 TEENAGE SOCIETY
during a long struggle in which the person decides "what he or
she is going to "be". Almost no one does what his father did
before him; instead, in a world of infinite possibilities, it has to
be worked out from nothing. This long process, new to the
world since the industrial revolution is the process we call
adolescence.
And this process of adolescence calls up an extraordinary hope.
Since coming of age traditionally marks the birth of self, might
not an extended coming of age bring with it a more profound
and varied self-conception?
That is the hope; but so far it hasn't worked that way. Every
culture that has an adolescent period has also a complicated
adolescent problem. Throughout the technically developed world,
puberty sets off a chain of forces that lead, in remarkably similar
ways, to crisis and impasse. High rates of delinquency, school
dropout, teenage suicide, drug addiction, and runaway are the
dramatic forms this problem takes. And under these circumstances
even "normal" adolescence is full of anxiety and, far from opening
the doors to a more whole and complicated self, it tends to
benumb us morally and intellectually.
The institution of the high school has particularly borne the
brunt of the adolescent problem. Just at the time when teenagers
need to band together freely in groups of their own making and
explore, step back from, and explore again, the adult world: its
work, love, science, laws, habits, travel, play, communications,
and governance, they get treated as if they were large children.
They have no more responsibility or authority in a high school
than the children in a kindergarten do. They are responsible for
putting away their things, and for playing in the school band,
perhaps even for electing class leaders. But these things all happen
in a kindergarten too. There is no new form of society, which is
a microcosm of adult society, where they can test their growing
adulthood in any serious way. And under these circumstances, the
adult forces which are forming in them, lash out, and wreak
terrible vengeance. Blind adults can easily, then, call this vengeance
"delinquency."
This has finally been recognized by an official agency. In
December  the National Commission on the Reform of
TOWNS
Secondary Education, working with the Kittering Foundation,
has come to the conclusion that the high schools in American
cities are simply not working; that they are breaking down as
institutions. They recommend that high school be non-compulsory
after I  years of age, and that teenagers be given many
options for participation in society; that the size of high schoo:s
be reduced drastically, so that they are not so much a world apart
from society; that each city provide opportunities for its young
to work as apprentices in the local businesses and services,-and
that such work be considered part of one's formal learning.
More specifically, we believe that the teenagers in a town,
boys and girls from the ages of about  to I , should be encouraged
to form a miniature society, in which they are as
differentiated, and as responsible mutually, as the adults in the
full-scale adult society. It is necessary that they are responsible
to one another, that they are able to play a usefu·l role with
respect to one another, that they have different degrees of power
and authority according to their age and their maturity. It is
necessary, in short, that their sodety is a microcosm of adult
society, not an artificial society where people play at being adult,
but the real thing, with real rewards, real tragedies, real work,
real love, real friendship, real achievements, real responsibility.
For this to happen it is necessary that each town have one or
more actual teenage societies, partly enclosed, watched over,
helped by adults, but run, essentially, by adults and the teenagers
together.
Therefore:
Replace the "high school" with an institution which is
actually a model of adult society, in which the students take
on most of the responsibility for learning and social life,
with clearly defined roles and forms of discipline. Provide
adult guidance, both for the learning, and the social structure
of the society; but keep them as far as feasible, in the
hands of the students.

  SHOPFRONT SCHOOLS

... the CHILDREN'S HOME 6 provides the beginning of
learning and forms the foundation of the NETWORK OF LEARNING
(18 in a community. As children grow older and more independent,
these patterns must be supplemented by a mass of
tiny institutions, schools ,rnd yet not schools, dotted among the
living functions of the community.
Around the age of  or , children develop a great need
to learn by doing, to make their mark on a community
outside the home. If the setting is right, these needs lead
children directly to basic skills and habits of learning.
The right setting for a child is the community itself, just as
the right setting for an infant learning to speak is his own home.
For example:
On the first day of school we had lunch in one of the Los Angeles
city parks. After lunch I gathered everyone, and I said, "Let's do
some tree identification," and they all moaned. So I said, "Aw,
come on, you live with these plants, you could at least know their
names. What's the name of these trees we're sitting under/"
They all looked up, and in unison said "Sycamores." So I said,
"What kind of sycamore " and no one knew. I got out my Trees of
North America book, and said, "Let's find out." There were only
three kinds of sycamore in the book, only one on the West Coast,
and it was called the California Sycamore. I thought it was all
over, but I persisted, "We better make sure by checking these trees
against the description in the book." So I suuted reading the text,
"Leaves: six to eight inches." I fished a cloth measuring tape out of
a box, handed it to Jeff, and said, "Go check out those leaves." He
found that the leaves were incleecl six to eight inches.
I went back to the book and read, " 'Height of mature trees,
30- feet.' How are we going to check that/" A big discussion
followed, and we finally decided that I should stand up against one
of the trees, they would back off as far as they could and estimate
how many "Rusches" high the tree was. A little simple multiplication
followed and we had an approximate tree height. Everyone was
pretty involved by now, so I asked them "How else could you do it1"
Eric was in the seventh grade and knew a little geometry, so he
taught us how to measure the height by triangulation.

TOWNS
I was delighted just to have everyone's attention, so I went back to
the book and kept reading. Near the bottom of the paragraph, came
the clincher, "Diameter: one to three feet." So I handed over the
measuring tape, and said, "Get me the diameter of that tree over
there." They went over to the tree, and it wasn't until they were
right on top of it that they realized that the only way to measure
the diameter of a tree directly is to cut it down. But I insisted that
we had to know the diameter of the tree, so two of them stretched
out the tape next to the tree, and by eyeballing along one "edge"
and then the other, they came up with eighteen inches,
I said, "Is that an accurate answer or just approximate?" They
agreed it was only a guess, so I said, "How else could you do it?"
Right off, Daniel said, "Well you could measure all the way
around it, lay that circle out in the dirt, and then measure across it."
I was really impressed, and said, "Go to it." Meanwhile, I turned
to the rest of the group, and said, "How else could you do it?"
Eric, who turned out to be a visualizer and was perhaps visualizing
the tree as having two sides, said, "Well, you could measure all the
way around it, and divide by two." Since I believe you learn at
least as much from mistakes as from successes, I said, "Okay, try it."
Meanwhile, Daniel was measuring across the circle on the ground,
and by picking the right points on a somewhat lopsided circle came
up with the same answer, "Eighteen inches." So I gave the tape to
Eric, he measured around the tree, got sixty inches, divided by two,
and got thirty for the diameter. He was naturally a little disappointed,
so I said, "Well, I like your idea, maybe you just have the
wrong number. Is there a better number to divide with than two?"
Right off, Michael said, "Well you could divide by three," and
then thinking ahead quickly added, "and subtract two."
I said, "Great! Now you have a formula, check it out on that tree
over there," pointing to one only about six inches in diameter. They
went over, measured the circumference, divided by three, subtracted
two, and checked it against a circle on the ground. The result was
disappointing, so I told them try some more trees. They checked
about three more trees and came back. "How did it work?"
"Well," Mark said, "Dividing by three works pretty well, but
subtracting two isn't so good."
"How good is dividing by three?" I asked, and Michael replied,
"It's not quite big enough."
"How big should it bel"
"About three and a half," said Daniel.
"No," said Michael, "It's more like three and an eighth."
At that point, these five kids, ranging in age from  to  were
within two one hundredths of discovering T and I was having
trouble containing myself. I suppose I could have extended the
lesson by having them convert one-eighth to decimals, but I was too
excited.

  SHOPFRONT SCHOOLS
"Look," I said, "I want to tell you a secret. There's a magic
number which is so special it has it own name. It's called -rr. And the
magic is that once you know how big it is, you can take any
circle, no matter how big or how small, and go from circumference
to diameter, or diameter to circumference. Now here is how it
works ... "
After my explanation, we went around the park, estimating the
circumferences of trees by guessing their diameter, or figuring the
diameter by measuring the circumference and dividing by -rr. Later
when I had taught them how to use a slide rule, I pointed out -,,. to
them and gave them a whole series of "tree" problems. Later still, I
reviewed the whole thing with telephone poles and lighting
standards, just to make sure that the concept of -,,. didn't disappear
into the obscurity of abstract mathematics. I know that I didn't
really understand -,,. until I got to college, despite an excellent math
program in high school. But for those five kids at least, -rr is
something real; it "lives" in trees and telephone poles. Charles

Architecture and Urban Planning, University of California, Los
Angeles, November 73.)
A few children in a bus, v1s1tmg a city park with a teacher.
That works because there are only a few children and one
teacher. Any public school can provide the teacher and the bus.
But they cannot provide the low student-teacher ratio, because
the sheer size of the school eats up all the money in administrative
costs and overheads-which end up making higher student
ratios economically essential. So even though everyone knows that
the secret of good teaching lies in low student-teacher ratios, the
schools make this one central thing impossible to get, because
they waste their money being large.
But as our example suggests, we can cut back on the overhead
costs of large concentrated schools and lower the studentteacher
ratio; simply by making our schools smaller. This approach
to schooling-the mini-school or shopfront school-has
been tried in a number of communities across the United States.
See, for instance, Paul Goodman, "Mini-schools: a prescription
for the reading problem," New York Review of Books, January
 To date, we know of no systematic empirical account of
this experiment. But a good deal has been written about these
schools. Perhaps the most interesting account is George Dennison's
The Lives of Children New York: Vintage Book, 69):

TOWNS
I would like to make clear that in constrasting our own pro: dures
with those of the public schools, I am not trying to criticize
the teachers who find themselves embattled in the institutional
setting and overbu;:dened to the point of madness .... My point is
precisely that the intimacy and small scale of our school should be
imitated widely, since these things alone make possible the human
contact capable of curing the diseases we have been naming with
such frequency for the last ten years.
Now that "mini-schools" are being discussed they have been
proposed most cogently by Paul Goodman and Dr. Elliott Shapiro),
it's worth saying that that's exactly what we were: the first of the
mini-schools ....
By eliminating the expenses of the centralized school, Dennison
found he was able to reduce the student-teacher ratio by a factor
of three!
For the twenty-three children there were three full-time teachers,
one part-time myself), and several others who came at scheduled
periods for singing, dancing, and music.
Public school teachers, with their  to I ratios, will be aware
that we have entered the realm of sheer luxury. One of the things
that will bear repeating, however, is that this luxury was purchased
at a cost per child a good bit lower than that of the public
system, for the similarity of operating costs does not reflect the huge
ca pita! investment of the public schools or the great difference in
the quality of service. Not that our families paid tuition hardly
anyone did ; I mean simply that our money was not drained away
by vast administrative costs, bookkeeping, elaborate buildings, maintenance,
enforcement personnel, and vandalism.
Charles Rusch, director of Moboc, Mobil Open Classroom, has
made the same discovery:
... by eliminating the building and the salaries of all those persons
who do not directly work with the children, the student/teacher
ratio can be reduced from something like / to 0/ . In this one
stroke many of the most pressing public school problems can be
eliminated at no extra cost to the school or school district. Rusch,
"Moboc: The Mobile Open Classroom," p. .

 CHILDREN'S HOME*
... within each neighborhood there are hundreds of children,
The children, especially the young ones, are helped in their relation
to the world by the patterns CHILDREN IN THE CITY )
and CONNECTED PLAY  ). However, these very general provisions
in the form of public land need to be supported by some
kind of communal place, where they can stay without their parents
for a few hours, or a few days, according to necessity. This
pattern is a part of the NETWORK OF LEARNING  for the
youngest children.
The task of looking after little children is a much deeper
and more fundamental social issue than the phrases "babysitting"
and "child care" suggest.
It is true, of course, that in a society where most children are
in the care of single adults or couples, the mothers and fathers
must be able to have their children looked after while they
work or when they want to meet their friends. This is what child
care and baby-sitting are for. It is, if you like, the adult's view
of the situation.
But the fact is that the children themselves have unsatisfied
needs which are equally pressing. They need access to other
adults beyond their parents, and access to other children; and the
situations in which they meet these other adults and other children
need to be highly complex, subtle, full of the same complexities
and intensities as family life-not merely "schools" and
"kindergarten" and "playgrounds."
When we look at the children's needs, and at the needs of the
adults, we realize that what is needed is a new institution in the
neighborhood: a children's home-a place where children can be
safe and well looked after, night and day, with the full range of
opportunities and social activities that can introduce them, fully,
to society.
To a certain extent, these needs were absorbed in the large,
extended families of the past. In such a family, the variety of
TOWNS
adults and children of other ages had a positive value for the children.
l t brought them into contact with more human situations,
allowed them to work out their needs with a variety of people,
not just two.
However, as this kind of family has gradually disappeared, we
have continued to hold fast to the idea that child-raising is the
job of the family alone, especially the mother. But it is no longer
viable. Here is Philip Slater discussing the difficulties that beset
a small nuclear family focussing its attention on one or two
children:
The new parents may not be as absorbed in material possessions
and occupational self-aggrandizement as their own parents were.
They may channel their parental vanity into different spheres, pushing
their children to be brilliant artists, thinkers, and performers.
But the hard narcissistic core on which the old culture was based
will not be dissolved until the parent-child relationship itself is deintensified
....
Breaking the pattern means establishing communities in which
(a children arc not socialized exclusively by their parents, b)
parents have lives of their own and do not live vicariously through
their children The Pursuit of Loneliness, Boston: Beacon Press,
1971, pp. 1-42).
The children's home we propose is a place which "de-intensifies
the parent-child relationship" by bringing the child into
authentic social relationships with several other adults and many
other children.
I. Physically, it is a very large, rambling home, with a goodsized
yard.
 The house is within walking distance of the children's own
homes. Terence Lee was found that young children who walk or
bike to school learn more than those who go by bus or car. The
mechanism is simple and startling. The children who walk or
bike, remain in contact with the ground, and are therefore able
to create a cognitive map which includes both home and school.
The children who are taken by car, are whisked, as if by magic
carpet, from one place to the other, and cannot maintain any
cognitive map which includes both home and school. To all intents
and purposes they feel lost when they are at school; they are perhaps
even afraid that they have lost their mothers. T. R. Lee,

tional adjustment in rural infant children," British Journal of
Educational Psychology,  : IOI, I   .)
 There is a core staff of two or three adults who manage
the home; and at least one of them, preferably more, actually
lives there. In effect, it is the real home of some people; it does
not close down at night.
 Parents and their children join a particular home. And then
the children may come and stay there at any time, for an hour,
an afternoon, sometimes for long overnight stays.
 Payment might be made by the hour to begin with. If we
assume $ I per hour as a base fee, and assume that a child might
spend  hours a week there, the house needs about  member
children to generate a monthly income of about $2500.
 The home focuses on raising children in a big extended
family setting. For example, the home might be the center of a
local coffee klatch, where a few people meet every day and mix
with the children.
 In line with this atmosphere, the home itself should be
relatively open, with a public path passing across the site. Silverstein
has indicated that the child's sense of his first school being
"separate" from society can be reduced if the play areas of the
children's home are open to all passing adults and to all passing
children. Murray Silverstein, "The Child's Urban Environment,"
Proceedings of the Seventy-First National Convention of
the Congress of Parents and Teachers, Chicago, Illinois, 67,
pp. -45.)
 To keep the young children safe, and to make it possible to
give them this great freedom without losing track of them altogether,
the play areas may be sunk slightly, and surrounded by a
low wall. If the wall is at seat height, it will encourage people to
sit on it-giving them a place from which to watch the children
playing, and the children a chance to talk to passers-by.
The children's home pattern has been tried, successfully, in a
far more extreme form than we imagine here, in many kibbutzim
where children are raised in collective nurseries, and merely visit
their parents for a few hours per week. The fact that this very
extreme version has been successful should remove any doubts
about the workability of the much milder version which we are
proposing.
Therefore:
TOWNS
In every neighborhood, build a children's home-a
second home for children-a large rambling house or
workplace-a place where children can stay for an hour or
two, or for a week. At least one of the people who run it
must live on the premises; it must be open  hours a day;
open to children of all ages; and it must be clear, from the
way that it is run, that it is a second family for the children
-not just a place where baby-sitting is available.

... the STREET CAFE 8 and CORNER GROCERY  and all
the individual shops and stalls in SHOPPING STREETS  2 and
MARKETS OF MANY SHOPS  must be supported by an ordinance
which guarantees that they will stay in local private hands, and
not be owned by absentee landlords, or chain stores, or giant
franchise operations.

When shops are too large, or controlled by absentee
owners, they become plastic, bland, and abstract.
The profit motive creates a tendency for shops to become
larger. But the larger they become, the less personal their service
is, and the harder it is for other small shops to survive. Soon,
the shops in the economy are almost entirely controlled by chain
stores and franchises.
The franchises are doubly vicious. They create the image of
individual ownership; they give a man who doesn't have enough
capital to start his own store the chance to run a store that seems
like his; and they spread like wildfire. But they create even more
plastic, bland, and abstract services. The individual managers have
almost no control over the goods they sell, the food they serve;
policies are tightly controlled; the personal quality of individually
owned shops is altogether broken down.
Shop run for money alone. Shop run as a way of life.
Communities can only get this personal quality back if they
prohibit all forms of franchise and chain stores, place limits on

TOWNS
the actual size of stores in a community, and prohibit absentee
owners from owning shops. In short, they must do what they can
to keep the wealth generated by the local community in the hands
of that community.
Even then, it will not be possible to maintain this pattern unless
the size of the shop spaces available for rent is small. One of
the biggest reasons for the rise of large, nationally owned franchises
is that the financial risks of starting a business are so
enormous for the average individual. The failure of a single owner's
business can be catastrophic for him personally; and it happens,
in large part because he can't afford the rent. Many hundreds
of tiny shops, with low rents, will keep the initial risk for
a shop keeper who is starting, to a minimum.
Shops in Morocco, India, Peru, and the oldest parts of older
towns, are often no more than  sguare feet in area. Just room
for a person and some merchandise-but plenty big enough.
Fifty square feet.
Therefore:
Do what you can to encourage the development of individually
owned shops. Approve applications for business
licenses only if the business is owned by those people who
actually work and manage the store. Approve new commercial
building permits only if the proposed structure includes
many very very small rental spaces.

+ ❖ +
The street cafe provides a unique setting, special to cities:
a place where people can sit lazily, legitimately, be on view,
and watch the world go by.
The most humane c1t1es are always full of street cafes. Let us
try to understand the experience which makes these places so
attractive.
We know that people enjoy mixing in public, in parks, squares,
along promenades and avenues, in street cafes. The preconditions
seem to be: the setting gives you the right to be there, by custom;
there are a few things to do that are part of the scene, almost
ritual: reading the newspaper, strolling, nursing a beer, playing
catch; and people feel safe enough to relax, nod at each other,
perhaps even meet. A good cafe terrace meets these conditions.
But it has in addition, special qualities of its own: a person may
sit there for hours-in public! Strolling, a person must keep up a
pace; loitering is only for a few minutes. You can sit still in a
park, but there is not the volume of people passing, it is more a
private, peaceful experience. And sitting at home on one's porch
is again different: it is far more protected; and there is not the
mix of people passing by. But on the cafe terrace, you can sit
still, relax, and be very public. As an experience it has special
possibilities; "perhaps the next person ... "; it is a risky place.
It is this experience that the street cafe supports. And it is one
of the attractions of cities, for only in cities do we have the concentration
of people required to bring it off. But this experience
need not be confined to the special, extraordinary parts of town.
In European cities and towns, there is a street cafe in every neighborhood-
they are as ordinary as gas stations are in the United

TOWNS
States. And the existence of such places provides social glue for
the community. They become like clubs-people tend to return to
their favorite, the faces become familiar. When there is a successful
cafe within walking distance of your home, in the neighborhood,
so much the better. It helps enormously to increase the
identity of a neighborhood. It is one of the few settings where a
newcomer to the neighborhood can start learning the ropes and
meeting the people who have been there many years.
The ingredients of a successful street cafc seem to be:
I. There is an established local clientele. That is, by name,
location, and staff, the cafe is ,·cry much anchored in the neighborhood
in which it is situated.
 In addition to the terrace which is open to the street, the
cafe contains several other spaces: with games, lire, soft chairs,
newspapers .... Th is allows a variety of people to start using it,
according to slightly different social styles.
 The cafe serves simple food and drinks-some alcoholic
drinks, but it is not a bar. It is a place where you are as likely to go
in the morning, to start the day, as in the evening, for a nightcap.
When these conditions are present, and the cafe takes hold, it
offers something unique to the lives of the people who use it: it
offers a setting for discussions of great spirit-talks, two-bit lectures,
half-public, half-private, learning, exchange of thought.
When we worked for the University of Oregon, we compared
the importance of such discussion in cafes and cafc-like places,
with the instruction students receive in the classroom. We interviewed
 students to measure the extent that shops and cafes contributed
to their intellectual and emotional growth at the University.
We found that "talking with a small group of students
in a coffee shop" and "discussion over a glass of beer" scored as
high and higher than "examinations" and "laboratory study."
Apparently the informal activities of shops and cafes contribute
as much to the growth of students, as the more formal educational
activities.
We believe this phenomenon is general. The quality that we
tried to capture in these interviews, and which is present m a
neighborhood ofc, is essential to all neighborhoods-not only
srndcnt neighborhoods. It is part of their life-blood.

 STREET CAFE
Therefore:
Encourage local cafes to spring up in each neighborhood.
Make them intimate places, with several rooms, open to a
busy path, where people can sit with coffee or a drink and
watch the world go by. Build the front of the cafe so that
a set of tables stretch out of the cafe, right into the street.

Build a wide, substantial opening between the terrace and the

double as A PLACE TO WAIT   0 for nearby bus stops and
offices; both indoors and on the terrace use a great variety of
different kinds of chairs and tables-DIFFERENT CHAIRS  I);
and give the terrace some low definition at the street edge if it
is in danger of being in terrnpted by street action-STAIR SEATS

 CORNER GROCERY*

... the major shopping needs, in any community, are taken
care of by the MARKET OF MANY SHOPS  ). However, the WEB
oF SHOPPING  r9 is not complete, unless there are also much
smaller shops, more widely scattered, he! ping to supplement
the markets, and helping to create the natural identity of IDENTIFIABLE
NEIGHBORHOODS( I ),
It has lately been assumed that people no longer want to
walk to local stores. This assumption is mistaken.
Indeed, we believe that people are not only willing to walk
to their local corner groceries, but that the corner grocery
plays an essential role in any healthy neighborhood: partly because
it is just more convenient for individuals; partly because it
helps to integrate the neighborhood as a whole.
Strong support for this notion comes from a study by Arthur
D: Little, Inc., which found that neighborhood stores are one
of the two most important elements in people's perception of an
area as a neighborhood Community Renewal Program, New
York: Praeger Press, 66). Apparently this is because local
stores are an important destination for neighborhood walks.
People go to them when they feel like a walk as well as when
they need a carton of milk. In this way, as a generator of walks,
they draw a residential area together and help to give it the
quality of a neighborhood. Similar evidence comes from a report
by the management of one of San Francisco's housing projects for
the elderly. One of the main reasons why people resisted moving
into some of the city's new housing projects, according to the
rental manager, was that the projects were not located in "downtown
locations, where . . . there is a store on every street
corner." San Francisco Chronicle, August r  r.)
To find out how far people will walk to a store we interviewed
 people at a neighborhood store in Berkeley. We found
that  per cent of the people interviewed walked, and that
those who walked all came three blocks or less. Over half of

TOWNS
them had been to the store previously within two days. On the
other hand, those who came by car usually came from more than
four blocks away. We found the pattern to be similar at other
public facilities in the neighborhoods that we surveyed. At
distances around four blocks, or greater, people who rode outnumbered
those who walked. It seems then, that corner groceries
need to be within walking distance, three to four blocks or I 00
feet, of every home.
But can they survive? Are these stores doomed by the economics
of scale? How many people does it take to support one
corner grocery? We may estimate the critical population for
grocery stores by consulting the yellow pages. For example, San
Francisco, a city of 50,000, has  neighborhood grocery
stores. This means that there is one grocery for every I I 0
people, which corresponds to Berry's estimate-see WEB OF SHOPPING
( I )-and corresponds also to the size of neighborhoodssee
lDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD ).
It seems, then, that a corner grocery can survive under circumstances
where there are  people within three or four
blocks-a net density of at least  persons per net acre, or six
houses per net acre. Most neighborhoods do have this kind of
density. One might even take this figure as a lower limit for a
viable neighborhood, on the grounds that a neighborhood ought
to be able to support a corner grocery, for the sake of its own
social cohesion.
Finally, the success of a neighborhood store will depend on its
location. It has been shown that the rents which owners of small
retail businesses are willing to pay vary directly with the amount
of pedestrian traffic passing by, and are therefore uniformly
higher on street corners than in the middle of the block. Brian
J. L. Berry, Geography of Market Centers and Retail Distribution,
Prentice Hall, I 67, p. .)
Therefore:
Give every neighborhood at least one corner grocery,
somewhere near its heart. Place these corner groceries every
 to  yards, according to the density, so that each one
serves about moo people. Place them on corners, where

... in an occasional neighborhood, which functions as the focus
of a group of neighborhoods, or in a boundary between neighborhoods-
NEIGHBORHOOD BOUNDARY )-or on the promenade
which forms the focus of a large community-PROMENADE 1),
NIGHT LIFE 3)-there is a special need for something larger
and more raucous than a street cafe.

Where can people sing, and drink, and shout and drink,
and let go of their sorrows?
A public drinking house, where strangers and friends are
drinking companions, is a natural part of any large community.
But all too often, bars degenerate and become nothing more than
anchors for the lonely. Robert Sommer has described this in
"Design for Drinking," Chapter  of his book Personal Space,
Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall,  .
. . . it is not difficult in any American city to find examples of the
bar where meaningful contact is at a minimum. V. S. Pritchett describes
the lonely men in New York City sitting speechlessly on a
row of barstools, with their arms triangled on the bar before a
bottle of beer, their drinking money before them. If anyone speaks
to his neighbor under these circu1nstances, he is likely to receive a
suspicious stare for his efforts. The barman is interested in the
patrons as customers-he is there to sell, they are there to buy ....
Another visiting Englishman makes the same point when he describes
the American bar as a "hoked up saloon; the atmosphere is as
chilly as the beer ... when I asked a stranger to have a drink,
he looked at me as if I were mad. In England if a guy's a stranger,
... each guy buys the other a drink. You enjoy each other's company,
and everyone is happy .... " Tony Kirby, "Who's Crazy?"
The Village Voice, January , 67, p. .)
Let us consider drinking more in the style of these English
pubs. Drink helps people to relax and become open with one
another, to sing and dance. But it only brings out these qualities
when the setting is right. We think that there are two critical
qualities for the setting:
I. The place holds a crowd that is continuously mixing be-

TOWNS
tween functions-the bar, the dance floor, a fire, darts, the
bathrooms, the entrance, the seats; and these activities are concentrated
and located round the edge so that they generate continual
criss-crossing.
 The seats should be largely in the form of tables for four
to eight set in open alcoves-that is, tables that are defined for
small groups, with walls, columns, and curtains-but open at
both ends.
T !te open alcove-supports tlte fluidity of the scene.
This form helps sustain the life of the group and lets people come
in and out freely. Also, when the tables are large, they invite
people to sit down with a stranger or another group.
Therefore:
Somewhere in the community at least one big place
where a few hundred people can gather, with beer and
wine, music, and perhaps a half-dozen activities, so that
people are continuously criss-crossing from one to another.

 I TRAVELER'S INN*
,
.,. •_<: J . I • \ -
,1'-/-_ I. '
... any town or city has v1s1tors and travelers passing througli.,
and these visitors will naturally tend to congregate around the
centers of activity-MAGIC OF THE CITY IO), ACTIVITY NODES
(30), PROMENADE 1), NIGHT LIFE 3), WORK COMMUNITY
(41). This pattern shows how the hotels which cater to these
visitors can most effectively help to sustain the life of these
centers.

A man who stays the night in a strange place is still a
member of the human community, and still needs company.
There is no reason why he should creep into a hole,
and watch TV alone, the way he does in a roadside motel.
At all times, except our own, the inn was a wonderful place,
where strangers met for a night, to eat, and drink, play cards, tell
stories, and experience extraordinary adventures. But in a modern
motel every ounce of this adventure has been lost. The motel
owner assumes that strangers are afraid of one another, so he
caters to their fear by making each room utterly self-contained
and self-sufficient.
But behind the fear, there is a deep need: the need for
company-for stories, and adventures, and encounters. It is the
business of an inn to create an atmosphere where people can experience
and satisfy this need. The most extreme version is the
Indian pilgrim's inn, or the Persian caravanserai. There people
eat, and meet, and sleep, and talk, and smoke, and drink in one
great space, protected from danger by their mutual company,
and given entertainment by one another's escapades and stories.
The inspiration for this pattern came from Gita Shah's description
of the Indian pilgrim's inn, in The Timeless Way of
Building:
In India, there are many of these inns. There is a courtyard
where the people meet, and a place to one side of the courtyard where
they eat, and also on this side there is the person who looks after
the Inn, and on the other three sides of the courtyard there are the
rooms-in front of the rooms is an arcade, maybe one step up from

TOWNS
the courtyard, and about ten feet deep, with another step leading
into the rooms. During the evening everyone meets in the courtyard,
and they talk and eat together-it is very special-and then at
night they all sleep in the arcade, so they are all sleeping together,
round the courtyard.
And of course, the size is crucial. The atmosphere comes
mainly from the fact that the people who run the place themselves
live there and treat the entire inn as their household. A
family can't handle more than  rooms.
Therefore:
Make the traveler's inn a place where travelers can take
rooms for the night, but where-unlike most hotels and
motels-the inn draws all its energy from the community
of travelers that are there any given evening. The scale
is small- or  guests to an inn; meals are offered
communally; there is even a large space ringed round with
beds in alcoves.

BUS STOP*

... within a town whose public transportation is based on MINIBUSES
(20), genuinely able to serve people, almost door to door,
for a low price, and very fast, there need to be bus stops within
a few hundred feet of every house and workplace. This pattern
gives the form of the bus stops.

Bus stops must be easy to recognize, and pleasant, with
enough activity around them to make people comfortable
and safe.
Bus stops are often dreary because they are set down independently,
with very little thought given to the experience of
waiting there, to the relationship between the bus stop and its
surroundings. They are places to stand idly, perhaps anxiously,
waiting for the bus, always watching for the bus. It is a shabby
experience; nothing that would encourage people to use public
transportation.
The secret lies in the web of relationships that are present in
the tiny system around the bus stop. If they knit together, and
reinforce each other, adding choice and shape to the experience,
the system is a good one: but the relationships that make up
such a system are extremely subtle. For example, a system as
simple as a traffic light, a curb, and street corner can be enhanced
by viewing it as a distinct node of public life: people wait for the
light to change, their eyes wander, perhaps they are not in such
a hurry. Place a newsstand and a flower wagon at the corner and
the experience becomes more coherent.
The curb and the light, the paperstand and the flowers, the
awning over the shop on the corner, the change in people's
pockets-all this forms a web of mutually sustaining relationships.
The possibilities for each bus stop to become part of such a web
are different-in some cases it will be right to make a system
that will draw people into a private reverie-an old tree; another
time one that will do the opposite-give shape to the social
possibilities-a coffee stand, a canvas roof, a decent place to sit
for people who are not waiting for the bus.

 BUS STOP
Two bus stops.
Therefore:
Build bus stops so that they form tiny centers of public
life. Build them as part of the gateways into neighborhoods,
work communities, parts of town. Locate them so
that they work together with several other activities, at
least a newsstand, maps, outdoor shelter, seats, and in
various combinations, corner groceries, smoke shops, coffee
bar, tree places, special road crossings, public bathrooms,
squares . ...

  FOOD STANDS*
4S4
... throughout the neighborhood there are natural public
gathering places-ACTIVITY NODES  0), ROAD CROSSINGS   ),
RAISED WALKS 5), SMALL PUBLIC SQUARES 1), BUS STOPS
( 2). All draw their life, to some extent, from the food stands,
the hawkers, and the vendors who fill the street with the smell of
food.
Many of our habits and institutions are bolstered by the
fact that we can get simple, inexpensive food on the street,
on the way to shopping, work, and friends.
The food stands which make the best food, and which contribute
most to city life, are the smallest shacks and carts from
which individual vendors sell their wares. Everyone has memories
of them.
But in their place we now have shining hamburger kitchens,
fried chicken shops, and pancake houses. They are chain operations,
with no roots in the local community. They sell "plastic,"
mass-produced frozen food, and they generate a shabby quality
of life around them. They are built to attract the eye of a person
driving: the signs are huge; the light is bright neon. They are
insensitive to the fabric of the community. Their parking lots
around them kill the public open space.
If we want food in our streets contributing to the social life
of the streets, not helping to destroy it, the food stands must be
made and placed accordingly.
We propose four rules:
I. The food stands are concentrated at ROAD CROSSINGS(  )
of the NETWORK OF PATHS AND CARS 2). It is possible to see
them from cars and to expect them at certain kinds of intersections,
but they do not have special par'king lots around them--see
NINE PER CENT PARKING 2).
 The food stands are free to take on a character that is
compatible with the neighborhood around them. They can be

TOWNS
freestanding carts, or built into the corners and crevices of
existing buildings; they can be small huts, part of the fabric of
the street.
 The smell of the food is out in the street; the place can
be surrounded with covered seats, sitting walls, places to lean
and sip coffee, part of the larger scene, not sealed away in a
plate glass structure, surrounded by cars. The more they smell, the
better.
 They are never franchises, but always operated by their
owners. The best food always comes from family restaurants; and
the best food in a foodstand always comes when people prepare
the food and sell it themselves, according to their own ideas, their
own recipes, their own choice.
Therefore:
Concentrate food stands where cars and paths meeteither

Treat these food stands as ACT!VITY POCKETS  I  when they
are part of a square; Use canvas roofs to make a simple shelter
over them-CANVAS ROOF  4); and keep them in line with the
precepts of INDIVIDUALLY OWNED SHOPS 7): the best food
always comes from people who are in business for themselves, who
buy the raw food, and prepare it in their own style.
 SLEEPING IN PUBLIC

THOROUGHFARE IOI), A PLACE TO WAIT  I 0 completely
public.

It is a mark of success in a park, public lobby or a porch,
when people can come there and fall asleep.
In a society which nurtures people and fosters trust, the fact
that people sometimes want to sleep in public is the most natural
thing in the world. If someone lies down on a pavement or a
bench and falls asleep, it is possible to treat it seriously as a need.
If he has no place to go then, we, the people of- the town, can
be happy that he can at least sleep on the public paths and
benches; and, of course, it may also be someone who does have
a place to go, but happens to like napping in the street.
But our society does not invite this kind of behavior. In our
society, sleeping in public, like loitering, is thought of as an
act for criminals and destitutes. In our world, when homeless
people start sleeping on public benches or in public buildings,
upright citizens get nervous, and the police soon restore "public
order."
Thus we cleared these difficult straits, my bicycle and I, together.
But a little further on I heard myself hailed. I raised my head and
saw a policeman. Elliptically speaking, for it was only later, by way
of induction, or deduction, I forget which, that I knew what it was.
What are you doing there? he said. I'm used to that question, I
understood it immediately. Resting, I said. Resting, he said. Resting, I
said. Will you answer my question? he cried. So it always is when
I'm reduced to confabulation. I honestly believe I have answered the
question I am asked and in reality I do nothing of the kind. I won't
reconstruct the conversation in all its meanderings. It ended in my understanding
that my way of resting, my attitude when at rest, astride
my bicycle, my arms on the handlebars, my head on my arms, was a
violation of I don't know what, public order, public decency ....
What is certain is this, that I never rested in that way again, my

feet obscenely resting on the earth, my arms on the handlebars and
on my arms my head, rocking and abandoned. It is indeed a deplorable
sight, a deplorable example, for the people, who so need
to be encouraged, in their bitter toil, and to have before their eyes
manifestations of strength only, of courage and joy, without which
they might collapse, at the end of the day, and roll on the ground.
(Samuel Beckett, Molloy.)
It seems, at first, as though this is purely a social problem and
that it can only be changed by changing people's attitudes. But
the fact is, that these attitudes are largely shaped by the environment
itself. In an environment where there are very few places
to lie down and sleep people who sleep in public seell\ unnatural,
because it is so rare.
Therefore:
Keep the environment filled with ample benches, comfortable
places, corners to sit on the ground, or lie in comfort
in the sand. Make these places relatively sheltered, protected
from circulation, perhaps up a step, with seats and
grass to slump down upon, read the paper and doze off.

BUILDINGS

This completes the global patterns which define a town
or a community. We now start that part of the language
which gives shape to groups of buildings, and individual
buildings, on the land, in three dimensions. These are
the patterns which can be "designed'' or "built"-the
patterns which define the individual buildings and the
space between buildings, where we are dealing for the
fir st time with patterns that are under the control of individuals
or small groups of individuals, who are able
to build the patterns all at once.
We assume that, based on the instructions m "Summary
of the Language," you have already constructed a
sequence of patterns. We shall now go through a step-bystep
procedure for building this sequence into a design.
r. The basic instruction is this: Take the patterns in
the order of the sequence, one by one, and let the form
grow from the fusion of these patterns, the site, and
your own instincts.
 It is essential to work on the site, where the project
is to be built; inside the room that is to be remodeled;
on the land where the building is to go up; and so forth.
And as far as possible, work with the people that are
actually going to use the place when it is finished: if you
are the user, all the better. But, above all, work on the
site, stay on the site, let the site tell you its secrets.
 Remember too, that the fo,;m will grow gradually
as you go through the sequence, beginning as something
very loose and amorphous, gradually becoming more
and more complicated, more refined and more differentiated,
more finished. Don't rush this process. Don't
BUILDINGS
give the form more order than it needs to meet the patterns
and the conditions of the site, each step of the way.
In effect, as you build each pattern into the design, you
will experience a single gestalt that is gradually becoming
more and more coherent.
 Take one pattern at a time. Open the page to the
first one and read it again. The pattern statement describes
the ways in which other patterns either influence
this pattern, or are influenced by it. For now, this information
is useful only in so far as it helps you to envision
the one pattern before you, as a whole.
 Now, try to imagine how, on your particular site,
you can establish this pattern. Stand on the site with
your eyes closed. Imagine how things might be, if the
pattern, as you have understood it, had suddenly sprung
up there overnight. Once you have an image of how it
might be, walk about the site, pacing out approximate
areas, marking the walls, using string and cardboard,
and putting stakes in the ground, or loose stones, to
mark the important corners.
 Complete your thought about this pattern, before
you go on to the next one. This means you must treat
the pattern as an "entity"; and try to conceive of this
entity, entire and whole, before you start creating any
other patterns.
 The sequence of the language will guarantee that
you will not have to make enormous changes which cancel
out your earlier decisions. Instead, the changes you
make will get smaller and smaller, as you build in more
and more patterns, like a series of progressive refinements,
until you finally have a complete design.
 Since you are building up your design, one pattern
BUILDINGS
at a time, it is essential to keep your design as fluid as
possible, while you go from pattern to pattern. As you
use the patterns, one after another, you will find that
you keep needing to adjust your design to accommodate
new patterns. It is important that you do this in a
loose and relaxed way, without getting the design more
fixed than necessary, and without being afraid to make
changes. The design can change as it needs to, so long
as you maintain the essential relationships and characteristics
which earlier patterns have prescribed. You will
see that it is possible to keep these essentials constant,
and still make minor changes in the design. As you include
each new pattern, you readjust the total gestalt of
your design, to bring it into line with the pattern you
are working on.
 While you are imagining how to establish one pattern,
consider the other patterns listed with it. Some are
larger. Some are smaller. For the larger ones, try to see
how they can one day be present in the areas you are
working on, and ask yourself how the pattern you are
now building can contribute to the repair or formation
of these larger patterns.
IO. For the smaller ones, make sure that your conception
of the main pattern will allow you to make these
smaller patterns within it later. It will probably be helpful
if you try to decide roughly how you are going to
build these smaller patterns in, when you come to them.
r r. Keep track of the area from the very beginning
so that you are always reasonably close to something you
can actually afford. We have had many experiences in
which people try to design their own houses, or other
buildings, and then get discouraged because the final cost
BUILDINGS
is too high, and they have to go back and change it.
To do this, decide on a budget, and use a reasonable
average square foot cost, to translate this budget into
square feet of construction. Say for the sake of argument,
that you have a budget of $30, for construction.
With help from builders, find out what kind of
square foot cost is reasonable for the kind of building
you are making. For example, in 76, in California, a
reasonable house, compatible with the patterns in the
last part of the language, can be built for some $28/
square foot. If you want expensive finishes, it will be
more. With $36, for construction, this will give you
some I  square feet.
 . Now, throughout the design process, keep this
I 00-square-foot figure in mind. If you go to two stories,
keep the ground area to  square feet. If you use only
part of the upstairs volume, the ground floor can go as
high as  or  square feet. If you decide to build
rather elaborate outdoor rooms, walls, trellises, reduce
the indoor area to make up for these outdoor costsperhaps
down to I JOO or I 00. And, each time you use
a pattern to differentiate the layout of your building further,
keep this total area in mind, so that you do not,
ever, allow yourself to go beyond your budget.
I . Finally, make the essential points and lines which
are needed to fix the pattern, on the site with bricks, or
sticks or stakes. Try not to design on paper; even in the
case of complicated buildings find a way to make your
marks on the site.
More detailed instructions, and detailed examples of
the design process in action, are given in chapters 0, 1,
and  of The Timeless Way of Building.
The first group of patterns helps to lay out the
overall arrangement of a group of buildings: the
height and number of these buildings, the entrances
to the site, main parking areas, and lines of
movement through the complex;

... this pattern, the first of the I  patterns which deal specifically
with buildings, is the bottleneck through which all languages
pass from the social layouts of the earlier patterns to the
smaller ones which define individual spaces.
Assume that you have decided to build a certain building.
The social groups or institutions which the building is meant to
house are given-partly by the facts peculiar to your own case,
and partly, perhaps, by earlier patterns. Now this pattern and the
next one-NUMBER OF STORIES  6), give you the basis of the
building's layout on the site. This pattern shows you roughly how
to break the building into parts. NUMBER OF STORIES helps you
decide how high to make each part. Obviously, the two patterns
must be used together.

A building cannot be a human building unless it is a
complex of still smaller buildings or smaller parts which
manifest its own internal social facts.
A building is a visible, concrete manifestation of a social group
or social institution. And since every social institution has smaller
groups and institutions within it, a human building will always
reveal itself, not as a monolith, but as a complex of these smaller
institutions, made manifest and concrete too.
A family has couples and groups within it; a factory has teams
of workers; a town hall has divisions, departments within the
large divisions, and working groups within these departments. A
building which shows these subdivisions and articulations in its
fabric is a human building-because it lets us live according to
the way that people group themselves. By contrast, any monolithic
building is denying the facts of its own social structure, and in
denying these facts it is asserting other facts of a less human kind
and forcing people to adapt their lives to them instead.
We have tried to make this feeling more precise by means
of the following conjecture: the more monolithic a building is,
and the less differentiated, the more it presents itself as an inBUILDINGS
human, mechanical factory. And when human organizations are
housed in enormous, undifferentiated buildings, people stop
identifying with the staff who work there as personalities and
think only of the institution as an impersonal monolith, staffed
by personnel. In short, the more monolithic the building is, the
more it prevents people from being personal, and from making
human contact with the other people in the building.
The strongest evidence for this conjecture that we have
found to date comes from a survey of visitors to public service
buildings in Vancouver, British Columbia. Prelimina,-y Program
for Massing Studies, Document : Visitor Survey, Environmental
Analysis Group, Vancouver, B.C., August 70. Two kinds of
public service buildings were studied-old, three story buildings
and huge modern office buildings. The reactions of visitors to the
small building differed from the reactions of visitors to the large
buildings in an extraordinary way. The people going to the small
buildings most often mentioned friendly and competent staff as the
important factor in their satisfaction with the service. In many
cases the visitors were able to give names and describe the people
with whom they had done business. Visitors to the huge office
buildings, on the other hand, mentioned friendliness and staff
competence rather infrequently. The great majority of these
visitors found their satisfaction in "good physical appearance, and
equipment."
In the monoliths, the visitors' experience is depersonalized.
They stop thinking primarily of the people they are going to
see and the quality of the relationship and focus instead on the
building itself and its features. The staff becomes "personnel,"
interchangeable, and indifferent, and the visitors pay little attention
to them as people-friendly or unfriendly, competent or
incompetent.
We learn also from this study that in the large buildings
visitors complained frequently about the "general atmosphere" of
the building, without naming specific problems. There were no
such complaints among the visitors to the smaller buildings. It is
as if the monoliths induce a kind of free-floating anxiety in
people: the environment "feels wrong," but it is hard to give a
reason. It m:iy be that the cause of the uneasiness is so simplethe
place is too big, it is difficult to grasp, the people are like
bees in a hive-that people are embarrassed to say it outright.

 BUILDING COMPLEX
("If it is as simple as that, I must be wrong-after all, there are
so many of these buildings.")
However it is, we take this evidence to indicate deep disaffection
from the human environment in the huge, undifferentiated
office buildings. The buildings impress themselves upon us as
things: objects, commodities; they make us forget the people inside,
as people; yet when we use these buildings we complain
vaguely about the "general atmosphere."
It seems then that the degree to which a building is broken
into visible parts doef affect the human relations among people
in the building. And if a building must, for psychological reasons,
be broken into parts, it seems impossible to find any rr :)re
natural way of breaking it down, than the one we have suggested.
Namely, that the various institutions, groups, subgroups, activities,
are visible in the concrete articulation of the physical building, on
the grounds that people will only be fully able to identify with
people in the building, when the building is a building complex.
A gothic cathedral-though an immense building-is an example
of a building complex. Its various parts, the spire, the aisle,
the nave, the chancel, the west gate, are a precise reflection of
the social groups-the congregation, the choir, the special mass,
and so forth.
And, of course, a group of huts in Africa, is human too, because
it too is a complex of buildings, not one huge building by
itself.
For a complex of buildings at high density, the easiest way of
all, of making its human parts identifiable, is to build it up from
narrow fronted buildings, each with its own internal stair. This
is the basic structure of a Georgian terrace, or the brownstones of
New York.
Therefore:
Never build large monolithic buildings. Whenever possible
translate your building program into a building complex,
whose parts manifest the actual social facts of the
situation. At low densities, a building complex may take the
form of a collection of small buildings connected by arcades,
paths, bridges, shared gardens, and wall .
At higher densities, a single building can be treated as a

BUILDINGS
building complex, if its important parts are picked out and
made identifiable while still part of one three-dimensional
fabric.
Even a small building, a house for example, can be conceived
as a "building complex"-perhaps part of it is higher
than the rest with wings and an adjoining cottage.

At the highest densities,  or  stories, and along pedestrian
streets, break the buildings into narrow, tall separate buildings,
side by side, with common walls, each with its own internal or
external stair. As far as possible insist that they be built piecemeal,
one at a time, so that each one has time to be adapted to its
neighbor. Keep the frontage as low as  or  feet. LONG THIN

 NUMBER OF STORIES*

... assume now, that you know roughly how the parts of the
building complex are to be articulated-BUILDING COMPLEX   ),
and how large they are. Assume, also, that you have a site. In order
to be sure that your building complex is workable within th.e
limits of the site, you must decide how many stories its different
parts will have. The height of each part must be constrained by
the FOUR-STORY LIMIT   I). Beyond that, it depends on the area
of your site, and the floor area which each part needs.

Within the four-story height limit, just exactly how high
should your buildings be?
To keep them small in scale, for human reasons, and to keep
the costs down, they should be as low as possible. But to make
the best use of land and to form a continuous fabric with surrounding
buildings, they should perhaps be two or three or four stories
instead of one. In this pattern we give rules for striking the balance.
Rule : Set a four-story height limit on the site. This rule
comes directly from FOUR-STORY LIMIT   I and the reasons for
establishing this limit are described there.
Rule : For any given site, do not let the ground area covered
by buildings exceed  per cent of the site. This rule requires that
for any given site, where it belongs to a single household or a
corporation, or whether it is a part of a larger site which contains
several buildings, at least half of the site is left as open space. This
is the limit of ground coverage within which reasonable site planning
can take place. The rule therefore determines the maximum
floor area that can be built with any given number of stories on a
given site. The ratio of indoor area to site area FAR-for floor
area ratio cannot thus exceed 0. in a single story building, I .o in
a two story, . in a three story and . in a four story building.
If the total floor area you intend to build plus the built floor
area that exists on the site is more than twice the area of the

 NUMBER OF STORIES
site itself, then you are exceeding this limit. In this case, we advise
that you cut back your program; build less space; perhaps
build some of your project on another site.
Rule : Do not let the height of your building(s vary too
much from the prerlominant height of surrounding builrlings.
A rule of thumb: do not let your buildings deviate more than
one story from surrounding buildings. On the whole, adjacent
buildings should be roughly the same height.
Breaking the rule of tliumb.
I live in a small one-story garden cottage at the back of a large
house in Berkeley. All around the cottage there are two-story houses,
some as close as thirty feet. I thought when I moved in, that a
garden cottage would be secluded and I would have some private
outdoor space. But instead I feel that I'm living in a goldfish bowlevery
one of the second-story windows around me looks right down
into my living room, or into my garden. The garden outside is useless,
and I don't sit near the window.
Therefore:
First, decide how many square feet of built space you
need, and divide by the area of the site to get the floor
area ratio. Then choose the height of your buildings according
to the floor area ratio and the height of the surrounding
buildings from the following table. In no case
build on more than  per cent of the land.

part clear, decide which building or which part of the building

 SHIELDED PARKING*
... many patterns we have given discourage dependence on
the use of cars; we hope that these patterns will gradually get
rid, altogether, of the need for large parking lots and parking
structures-LOCAL TRANSPORT AREAS II) NINE PER CENT
PARKING 2). However, in certain cases, unfortunately, large
areas of parking are still necessary. Whenever this is so, this
parking must be placed very early, to be sure that it does not
destroy the BUILDING COMPLEX    altogether.
+ ❖ ❖
Large parking structures full of cars are inh,uman and
dead buildings-no one wants to see them or walk by
them. At the same time, if you are driving, the entrance
to a parking structure is essentially the main entrance to
the building-and it needs to be visible.
In NINE PER CENT PARKING 2), we have already defined an
upper limit on the total amount of parking in a neighborhood.
In SMALL PARKING LOTS  03 we give the best SiZe and the
distribution of the lots when they are on the ground. But in
certain cases it is still necessary to build larger parking lots or
parking structures. The environment can tolerate these larger
lots and structures, provided that they are built so that they do
not pollute the land around them.
This is a simple biological principle. In the human body, for
example, there are waste products; the waste products are part
of the way the body works, and obviously they must have a place.
But the stomach and colon are built in such a way as to shield the
other internal organs from the poisons carried by the wastes.
The same is true in a city. At this moment in history the city
requires a certain limited amount of parking; and for the time
being there is no getting away from that. But the parking must be
built in such a way that it is shielded-by shops, houses, hills of

BUILDINGS
grassy earth, walls, or any other buildings of any kind-anything,
so long as the interior of the parking structure and the cars are
not visible from the surrounding land. On ground level, the shield
is especially critical. Shops are useful since they generate their
own pedestrian scale immediately. And since the need for parking
often goes hand in hand with commercial development, shops are
often very feasible economically.
A shielded parking strncture.
And of course, the houses themselves can serve the same function.
In Paris, many of the most charming and beautiful apartment
houses are arranged around courtyards, which permit
parking inside, away from the street. There are few enough cars,
so that they don't destroy the courtyard, for the houses; and the
street is left free of parked cars en ti rely.
Along with the need to shield parking structures there is the
egually pressing need on the part of a driver to be able to spot
the parking structure quickly-and see how it is connected to the
building he is headed for. One of the most freguent complaints
about the parking near a building is not that it is too far away, but
that you don't know where you can go to find a parking spot and
still be sure of how to get back into the building.
This means that
I. Parking, which is specifically for the use of v1s1wrs, must
be clearly marked from the directions of approach, even though
the structure as a whole is shielded. The person who is coming by
car will be looking for the building, not the parking lot. The entrance
to parking must be marked as an important entrance-a gate
-so that you can see it automatically, in the process of looking
for the building. And it must be placed so that you find it about
the same time that you see the building's main entrance.
 While you are parking your car you must be able to see the
exit from the parking area which will lead you into the building.
This will let you search for the closest spots, and will mean that
you don't have to walk around searching for the exit.
 SHIELDED PARKING
Therefore.
Put all large parking lots, or parking garages, behind
some kind of natural wall, so that the cars and parking
structures cannot be seen from outside. The wall which
surrounds the cars may be a building, connected houses,
or housing hills, earth berms, or shops.
Make the entrance to the parking lot a natural gateway
to the buildings which it serves, and place it so that you can
easily see the main entrance to the building from the entrance
to the parking.

For shields see HOUSING HILL ), HOUSING IN BETWEEN

GALLERY SURROUND  I 6). One of the cheapest ways of all to
shield a parking lot is with canvas awnings-the canvas can be
many colors: underneath, the light is beautiful-CANVAS ROOFS
(244). Make certain that the major entrances of buildings are
quite clearly visible from the place where you drive into parking
lots, and from the places where you leave the parking lots on
foot-CIRCULATION REALMS 8), FAMILY OF ENTRANCES 02),

CIRCULATION REALMS**
... once you have some rough idea how many buildings you
are going to build-BUILDING COMPLEX 5), and how high they
are to be-NUMBER OF STORIES  6), you can work out roughly
what kind of layout they should have to make the access to them
clear and comfortable. This pattern defines the overall philosophy
of layout.
In many modern building complexes the problem of
disorientation is acute. People have no idea where they are,
and they experience considerable mental stress as a result .
. . . the terror of being lost comes from the necessity that a
mobile organism be oriented in its surroundings. Jaccard quotes an
incident of native Africans who became disoriented. They were
stricken with panic and plunged wildly into the bush. Witkin tells
of an experienced pilot who lost his orientation to the vertical, and
who described it as the most terrifying experience in his life. Many
other writers in describing the phenomenon of temporary disorientation
in the modern city, speak of the accompanying emotions of
distress. Kevin Lynch, The Image of t!te City, Cambridge, Mass.:
MIT Press, 60, p.  .)
It is easiest to state the circulation problem for the case of a
complete stranger who has to find his way around the complex of
buildings. Imagine yourself as the stranger, looking for a particular
address, within the building. From your point of view, the building
is easy to grasp if someone can explain the position of this
address to you, in a way you can remember easily, and carry in
your head while you are looking for it. To put this in its most
pungent form: a person must be able to explain any given address
within the building, to any other person, who does not know
his way around, in one sentence. For instance, "Come straight
through the main gate, down the main path and turn into the
second little gate, the small one with the blue grillwork-you can't
miss my door."
At first sight, it might seem that the problem is only important
for strangers-since a person who is familiar with a building
can find his way around no matter how badly it is organized.
BUILDINGS
However, psychological theory suggests that the elf ect of badly
laid ont circulation has almost as bad an effect on a person who
knows a building, as it does on a stranger. We may assume that
every time a person goes toward some destination, he must carry
some form of map or instruction in his mind. The question arises:
How much of the time does he have to be consciously thinking
about this map and his destination/ If he spends a great deal of
time looking out for landmarks, thinking about where to go next,
then his time is entirely occupied, and leaves him little time for
the process of reflection, tranquil contemplation, and thought.
We conclude that any environment which requires that a person
pay attention to it constantly is as bad for a person who knows it,
as for a stranger. A good environment is one which is easy to
understand, without conscious attention.
What makes an environment easy to understand  What makes
an environment confusing/ Let us imagine that a person is going
to a particular address within a building. Call this address A. The
person who is looking for A does not go directly toward A-unless
it happens to be visible from the point where he starts. Instead,
he sets his journey up to form a series of steps, in which each step
is a kind of temporary intermediate goal, and a taking off point
for the next step. For example: First go through the gate, then to
the second courtyard on the left, then to the right-hand arcade
of the courtyard, and then through the third door. This sequence
is a kind of map which the person has in his head. If it is
always easy to construct such a map, it is easy to find your way
around the building. If it is not easy, it is hard to find your way
around.
T!te way the map in your mind works.
 CIRCULATION REALMS
A map works because it identifies a nested system of realms in
the case of our example the realms arc first, the building itself,
then the courtyard, then the arcade, then the room itself, the
destination). The map guides you to the entrance of the largest
realm, and from there to the entrance of the next largest realm,
and so on. You make one decision at a time, and each decision
yon make narrows down the extent of the building which remains
to be explored, until you finally narrow it down to the particular
address you are looking for.
It seems reasonable to say that any useful map through a building
complex must have this structure, and that any building
complex in which you cannot create maps of this kind is confusing
to be in. This is borne out by intuition. Consider these
two examples; each has a system of realms which allows you to
make such maps very easily.
An Oxford college. Here the college is made up of courts, each
court has a collection of rooms called a "staircase" opening off it,
and the individual suites of rooms open off these staircases. The
realms are: College, Courts, Staircases, Rooms.
Manhattan. Here the city is made up of major areas, each
major area has certain central streets and arteries. The realms are:
M,mhattan, Districts, Realms dclincd by the avenues, and Realms
delined by cross streets and individual buildings. Manhattan is
clear because the districts are so well defined, and the realms
defined by the streets arc subordinate to the realms delined by the
avenues.
We conclude that in order to be clear, a building complex
must follow three rules:
I. It is possible to identify a nested system of realms in the
complex, the first and largest of these realms being the entire
complex.
 Each realm has a main circulation space, which opens directly
from the entrances to that realm.
 The entrances to any realm open directly off the circulation
space of the next larger realm above it.
We emphasize finally, that these realms at every level must
have names; and this requires, in turn, that they be well enough
delined physically, so that they can in fact be named, and so that
one knows where the realm of that name starts, and where it
stops. The realms do not have to be as precise as m the two examples
we have given. But they must have enough psychological
substance and existence so that they can honestly work ,1s realms
in somebody's mind.
Therefore:
Lay out very large buildings and collections of small
buildings so that one reaches a given point inside by passing
through a sequence of realms, each marked by a gateway
and becoming smaller and smaller, as one passes from
each one, through a gateway, to the next. Choose the realms
so that each one can be easily named, so that you can tell
a person where to go, simply by telling him which realms
to go through.

high the buildings will be-NUMBER OF STORIES( 6)-it is time
to try and find the natural heart or center of the building complex,
to help complete its CIRCULATIONR EALMS( 8).
A complex of buildings with no center s like a man
without a head.
In circulation realms we have cxphined how people understand
their surroundings and orient themselves in their surroundings
by making mental maps. Such a map needs a point of reference:
some point in the complex of buildings, which is very obvious,
and so placed, that it is possible to refer all the other paths
and buildings to it. A main building, which is also the functional
soul of the complex, is the most likely candidate for this reference
point. Without a main building, there is very little chance of
any natural points of reference being strong enough to act as an
organizer for one's mental map.
Furthermore, from the point of view of the group of users-the
workers or the inhabitants-the sense of community and connection
is heightened wf-len one building or a part of one building is
singled out and treated as a main building, common to all, the
heart of the institution. Some examples: the meeting hall among
a collection of government buildings; a guild hall in a work community;
the kitchen and family room in a commu11Jl household;
the merry-go-round in a park; a temple on sacred ground; the
swimming pavilion in a health center; the workshop in an oflice.
Great care must be taken to pick that function which is
actually the soul of the group, in human terms, for the main
building. Otherwise, some irrelevant set of functions will dominate
the building complex. The United Nations complex in
New York fails for just this reason. The General Assembly, the
heart and soul of the institution, is dwarfed by the bureaucratic
Secretariat. And, indeed, this institution has suffered from the
 MAIN BUILDING
red-tape mentality. See the excellent series of articles by Lewis
Mumford, discussing the U.N. buildings in From the Ground
Up, Harvest Books, 56, pp. 0-70.)
Therefore:
For any collection of buildings, decide which building
in the group houses the most essential function-which
building is the soul of the group, as a human institution.
Then form this building as the main building, with a
central position, higher roof.
Even if the building complex is so dense that it is a
single building, build the main part of it higher and more
prominent than the rest, so that the eye goes immediately
to the part which is the most important.

❖ + +
The simple social intercourse created when people rub
shoulders in public is one of the most essential kinds of
social "glue" in society.
In today's society this situation, and therefore this glue, is
largely missing. It is missing in large part because so much of the
actual process of movement is now taking place in indoor corridors
and lobbies, instead of outdoors. This happens partly because the
cars have taken over streets, and made them uninhabitable, and
partly because the corridors, which have been built in response,
encourage the same process. But it is doubly damaging in its
effect.
It is damaging because it robs the streets of people. Most of the
moving about which people do is indoors-hence lost to the
street; the street becomes abandoned and dangerous.
And it is damaging because the indoor lobbies and corridors are
most often dead. This happens partly because indoor space is not
as public as outdoor space; and partly because, in a multi-story
building each corridor carries a lower density of traffic than a
public outdoor street. It is therefore unpleasant, even unnerving,
to move through them; people in them are in no state to generate,
or benefit from, social intercourse.
To recreate the social intercourse of public movement, as far as
possible, the movement between rooms, offices, departments, buildings,
must actually be outdoors, on sheltered walks, arcades, paths,
BUILDINGS
streets, which are truly public and separate from cars. Individual
wings, small buildings, departments must as often as possible have
their own entrances-so that the number of entrances onto the
street increases and life comes back to the street.
In short, the solution to these two problems we have mentioned
-the streets infected by cars and the bland corridors-is the
pedestrian street. Pedestrian streets are both places to walk along
( from car, bus, or train to one's destination and places to pass
through between apartments, shops, offices, services, classes).
To function properly, pedestrian streets need two special properties.
First, of course, no cars; but frequent crossings by streets
with traffic, see NETWORK OF PATHS AND CARS 2): deliveries and
other activities which make it essential to bring cars and trucks
onto the pedestrian street must be arranged at the early hours of
the morning, when the streets are deserted. Second, the buildings
along pedestrian streets must be planned in a way which as nearly
as possible eliminates indoor staircases, corridors, and lobbies, and
leaves most circulation outdoors. This creates a street lined with
stairs, which lead from all upstairs offices and rooms directly to
the street, and many many entrances, which help to increase the
life of the street.
Finally it should be noted that the pedestrian streets which
seem most comfortable are the ones where the width of the street
does not exceed the height of the surrounding buildings. See
"Vehicle free zones in city centers," International Brief # ,
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of
International Affairs, June 72).
A bout square or even narrower.
Therefore:
Arrange buildings so that they form pedestrian streets
with many entrances and open stairs directly from the
upper storys to the street, so that even movement between
rooms is outdoors, not just movement between buildings.

IO I BUILDING THOROUGHFARE

... if the building complex is built at high density, then at least
part of the circulation cannot be made of outdoor PEDESTRIAN
STREETS rno because the buildings cover too much of the land;
in this case, the main spines of the CIRCULATION REALMS  8)
must take the form of building thoroughfares similar to pedestrian
streets, but partly or wholly inside the buildings. Building
thoroughfares replace the terrible corridors which destroy so
much of modern building, and help to generate the indoor layout
of a BUILDING COMPLEX   ).
When a public building complex cannot be completely
served by outdoor pedestrian streets, a new form of indoor
street, quite different from the conventional corridor, is
needed.
An indoor street.
The problem arises under two conditions.
r. Cold weather. In very cold climates to have all circulation
outdoors inhibits social communication instead of helping it. Of
course, a street can be roofed, particularly with a glass roof. But as
soon as it becomes enclosed, it has a different social ecology and
begins to function differently.
 High density. When a building complex is so tightly packed

BUILDINGS
on the site that there is no reasonable space for outdoor streets
because the entire building complex is a continuous two, three, or
four story building, it becomes necessary to think of major
thoroughfares in different terms.
To solve the problems posed by these conditions, streets must
be replaced by indoor thoroughfares or corridors. But the moment
we put them indoors and under cover, they begin to suffer
from entirely new problems, which are caused by the fact that
they get sterilized by their isolation. First, they become removed
from the public realm, and are often deserted. People hardly ever
feel free to linger in public corridors when they are off the street.
And second, the corridors become so unfriendly that nothing ever
happens there. They are designed for scuttling people through,
but not for staying in.
In order to solve these new problems, created when we try to
put a street indoors, the indoor streets-or building thoroughfares
-need Ii ve speci fie characteristics.
I. Shortcut
Public places are meant to invite free loitering. The public
places in community buildings city halls, community centers,
public libraries especially need this quality, because when people
feel free to hang around they will necessarily get acquainted with
what goes on in the building and may begin to use it.
But people rarely feel free to stay in these places without an
Official Reason. Goffman describes this situation as follows:
Being present in a public place without an orientation to apparent
goals outside the situation is sometimes called lolling, when position
is fixed, and loitcri ng, when some movement is entailed. Either can
be deemed sufficiently improper to merit leg;al action. On many of our
city streets, especiaJly at certain hours, the police will question anyone
who appears to be doing nothing and ask him to "move along."
(In London, a recent court ruling established that an individual has
a right to walk on the street but no legal right merely to stand on
it. In Chicago, an individual in the uniform of a hobo can loll
on "the stem," but once off this preserve he is required to look as
if he were intent on getting to some business destination. Similarly,
some mental patients owe their commitment to the fact that the
police found them wandering on the streets at off hours without any
apparent destination or purpose in mind. Erving Goffman, Behavior
in Public Places, New York: Free Press, 63, p. .)

IOI BUILDING THOROUGHFARE
If a public space is to be really useful it must somehow help to
counter the anti-loitering tendency in modern society. Specifically,
we have observed these problems:
a. A person wiU not use a public place if he has to make a
special motion toward it, a motion which indicates the intention
to use the facility "officially."
b. If people are asked to state their reason for being in a place
(for example, by a receptionist or clerk they won't use it freely.
c. Entering a public space through doors, corridors, changes of
level, and so on, tends to keep away people who are not entering
with a specific goal in mind.
Places which overcome these problems, like the Galleria in
Milan, all have a common characteristic: they all have public
thoroughfares which slice through them, lined with places to
stop and loiter and watch the scene.
Shortcuts.
 Width
An indoor street needs to be wide enough for people to feel
comfortable walking or stopping along the way. Informal experiments
help to determine how much space people need when they
pass others. Since the likelihood of three people passing three
people is not high, we consider as a maximum two people passing
two people, or three people passing one person. Each person
takes about two feet; there needs to be about one foot between
two groups which pass, so that they do not feel crowded; and

BUILDINGS
people usually walk at least one foot away from the wall. The
street width, therefore, should be at least I  feet.
Our experiments also indicate that a person seated or standing
at the edge of a street feels uncomfortable if anyone passes closer
than live feet. Thus, in places in the street where seats, activities,
entrances, and counters are placed, the street should widen to
about  feet  one-sided or  feet two-sided).
 Height
Ceiling heights should also feel comfortable for people walking
or standing along an indoor street, According to CEILING HEIGHT
VARIETY  I 0), the height of any space should be equal to the
appropriate horizontal social distances between people for the
given situation-the higher the ceiling, the more distant people
seem from each other.
Edward Hall, in The Hidden Dimension, suggests that a comfortable
distance between strangers is the distance at which you
cannot distinguish the details of their facial features. He gives
this distance as being between  and  feet. Thus, the ceiling
height in an indoor street should be at least in that range.
Where people sit and stand talking to each other, the appropriate
social distance is more intimate. Hall gives it a dimension
of four to seven feet. Thus, the ceiling in activity and "edge"
places should be seven feet.
This suggests, for a large indoor street, a ceiling that is high
in the middle and low at the edges. In the middle, where people
are passing through and are more anonymous, the ceiling may be
I  to  feet high, or even higher, according to the scale of the
passage. Along the edges of the thoroughfare, where people are
invited to stop and become slightly more engaged in the life of
the build·ing, the ceilings may be lower. Here are three sections
through an indoor street which have this property.
Cross sections of an indoor street.
IOI BUILDING THOROUGHFARE
 Wide entrance
As far as possible, the indoor street should be a continuation
of the circulation outside the building. To this end, the path into
the building should be as continuous as possible, and the entrance
quite wide-more a gateway than a door. An entrance that is
feet wide begins to have this character.
 Involvements along the edge
To invite the free loitering described above under Shortcut,
the street needs a continuum of various "involvements" along
its edge.
Rooms next to the street should have windows opening onto
the street. We know it is unpleasant to walk down a corridor
lined with blank walls. Not only do you lose the sense of where
you are but you get the feeling that all the life in the building
is on the other side of the walls, and you feel cut off from it.
We guess that this contact with the public is not objectionable
for the workers, so long as it is not too extreme, that is, as long as
the workplace is protected either by distance or by a partial wall.
The corridor should be lined with seats and places to stop,
such as newspaper, magnine, and candy stands, bulletin boards,
exhibits, and displays.
Where there are entrances and counters of offices and services
off the corridor, they should project into the corridor. Like activities,
entrances and counters create places in the corridor, and
should be combined with seats and other places to stop. In most
public service buildings these counters and entrances are usually
set back from corridors which makes them hard to see, and
emphasizes the difference between the corridor as a place for
passing through, and the office as a place where things happen.
The problems can be solved if the entrances and counters project
into the corridor and become part of it.
Therefore:
Wherever density or climate force the main lines of
circulation indoors, build them as building thoroughfares.
Place each thoroughfare in a position where it functions
as a shortcut, as continuous as possible with the public street

BUILDINGS
outside, with wide open entrances. And line its edges with
windows, places to sit, counters, and entrances which project
out into the hall and expose the buildings' main functions
to the public. Make it wider than a normal corridor-at least
II feet wide and more usually,  to  feet wide; give it
a high ceiling, at least  feet, with a glazed roof if possible
and low places along the edge. If the street is several
stories high, then the walkways along the edges, on the
different stories, can be used to form the low places.

 FAMILY OF ENTRANCES*

... tl1is pattern is an embellishment of CIRCULATION REALMS
( 8). CIRCULATION REALMS portrayed a series of realms, in a
large building or a building complex, with a major entrance or
gateway into each realm and a collection of minor doorways,
gates, and openings off each realm. This pattern applies to the
relationship between these "minor" entrances.
When a person arrives in a complex of offices or services
or workshops, or in a group of related houses, there is a
good chance he will experience confusion unless the whole
collection is laid out before him, so that he can see the entrance
of the place where he is going.
In our work at the Center we have encountered and defined
several versions of this pattern. To make the general problem
clear, we shall go through these cases and then draw out the
general rule.
I. In our multi-service center project we called this pattern
Overview of Services. We found that people could find the;r
way around and see exactly what the building had to offer, if
the various services were laid out in a horseshoe, directly visible
from the threshold of the building. See A Pattern Lang11age
Which Generates Multi-Service Centers, pp. -26.
Over-view of services_
 Another version of the pattern, called Reception Nodes,
was used for mental health clinics, In these cases we specified one

I FAMILY OF ENTRANCES
clearly defined main entrance, with main reception clearly visible
inside this main entrance and each "next" point of reception then
visible from the previous one, so that a patient who might be
frightened or confused could find his way about by asking receptionists-
and could always be directed to the next, visible
receptionist down the line.
•re,,

Reception nodes.
 In our project for re-building the Berkeley City Hall
complex, we used another version of the pattern. Within the
indoor streets, the entrance to each service was made in a similar
way-each one bulged out slightly into the street, so that people
could easily find their way around among the resulting family of
entrances.
Family of entrances.
 We have also applied the pattern to houses which arc laid
out to form a cluster. In one example the pattern drew different
house entrances toget!-ier to make a mutually visible collection of
them, and again gave each of them a similar shape.
In all these cases, the same central problem exists. A person
who is looking for one of several entrances, and doesn't know his
way around, needs to have some simple way of identifying the
one entrance he wants. It can be identified as "the blue one,"
"the one with the mimosa bush outside," "the one with a big
on it," or "the last one on the right, after you get round the

BUILDINGS
corner," but in every case the identification of "the one ... "
can only make sense if the entire collection of possible entrances
can first be r ,en and understood as a collection. Then it is possible
to pick one tarticular entrance out, without conscious effort.
Therefore:
Lay out the entrances to form a family. This means:
r. They form a group, are visible together, and each s
visible from all the others.
 They are all broadly similar, for instance all porches,
or all gates in a wall, or all marked by a similar kind
of doorway.
In detail, make the entrances bold and easy to see-MAIN
ENTRANCE II o ; when they lead into private domains, houses
and the like, make a transition in between the public street and
the inside-ENTRANCE TRANSITION II ); and shape the entrance
itself as a room, which straddles the wall, and is thus
both inside and outside as a projecting volume, covered and
protected from the rain and sun-ENTRANCE ROOM 0). If it
is an entrance from an indoor street into a public office, make
reception part of the entrance room-RECEPTION WELCOMES
YOU  ....

 SMALL PARKING LOTS*
since a small parking lot is a kind of gateway-the place
where you leave your car, and enter a pedestrian realm-this
pattern helps to complete SHOPPING STREETS   ), HOUSE
CLUSTER ), WORK COMMUNITY 1), GREEN STREETS 1),
MAIN GATEWAYS 3), CIRCULATION REALMS 8), and any other
areas which need small and convenient amounts of parking. But
above all, if it is used correctly, this pattern, together with
SHIELDED PARKING 7), will help to generate NINE PER CENT
PARKING  2 gradually, by increments.

Vast parking lots wreck the land for people.
In NINE PER CENT PARKING   ), we have suggested that the
fabric of society is threatened by the mere existence of cars, if
areas for parked cars take up more than  or Io per cent of the
land in a community.
We now face a second problem. Even when parked cars occupy
less than  per cent of the land, they can still be distributed in
two entirely different ways. They can be concentrated in a few
huge parking lots; or they can be scattered in many tiny parking
lots. The tiny parking lots are far better for the environment
than the large ones, even when their total areas are the same.
Large parking lots have a way of taking over the landscape,
creating unpleasant places, and having a depressing effect on the
hl'J "'ltl \u - '.

open space around them. They make people feel dominated by
cars; they separate people from the pleasure and convenience of
being near their cars; and, if they are large enough to contain
unpredictable traffic, they are dangerous for children, since
children inevitably play in parking lots.
The problems stem essentially from the fact that a car is so
much bigger than a person. Large parking lots, suited for the cars,
have all the wrong properties for people. They are too wide;
they contain too much pavement; they have no place to linger. In
fact, we have noticed that people speed up when they are walking
through large parking lots to get out of them as fast as possible.
It is hard to pin down the exact size at which parking lots
become too big. Our observations suggest that parking lots for
four cars are still essentially pedestrian and human in character;
that lots for six cars are acceptable; but that any area near a
parking lot which holds eight cars is already clearly identifiable as
"car dominated territory."
This may be connected with the well-known perceptual facts
about the number seven. A collection of less than five to seven
objects can be grasped as one thing, and the objects in it can be
grasped as individuals. A collection of more than five to seven
things is perceived as "many things." See G. Miller, "The
Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on
Our Capacity for Processing Information," in D. Beardslee and
M. Wertheimer, eds., Readings in Perception, New York, 58,
esp. p. 03. It may be true that the impression of a "sea of cars"
first comes into being with about seven cars.
T lie small lots can be quite loosely placed.

BUILDINGS
Therefore:
Make parking lots small, serving no more than five to
seven cars, each lot surrounded by garden walls, hedges,
fences, slopes, and trees, so that from outside the cars are
almost invisible. Space these small lots so that they are at
least rno feet apart.
five to seven cars
Place entrances and exits of the parking lots in such a way
that they fit naturally into the pattern of pedestrian movement
and lead directly, without confusion, to the major entrances to
individual buildings-CIRCULATION REALMS  8). Shield even
these quite modest parking lots with garden walls, and trees, and
fences, so that they help to generate the space around themPOSITIVE

... the most general aspects of a building complex are established
in BUILDING COMPLEX 5), NUMBER OF STORIES 6),
and CIRCULATION REALMS 8). The patterns which follow, and
all remaining patterns in the language, concern the design of one
single building and its surroundings. This pattern explains the
very first action you must take-the process of repairing the site.
Since it tends to identify very particular small areas of any site
as promising areas of development, it is greatly supported by
BUILDING COMPLEX    which breaks buildings into smaller
parts, and therefore makes it possible to tuck them into different
corners of the site in the hest places.
Buildings must always be built on those parts of the land
which are in the worst condition, not the best.
This idea is indeed very simple. But it is the exact opposite of
what usually happens; and it takes enormous will power to follow
it through.
What usually happens when someone thinks of building on a
piece of land? He looks for the best site-where the grass is most
beautiful, the trees most healthy, the slope of the land most
even, the view most lovely, the soil most fertile-and that is just
where he decides to put his house. The same thing happens
whether the piece of land is large or small. On a small lot in a
town the building goes in the sunniest corner, wherever it is most
pleasant. On a hundred acres in the country, the buildings go on
the niost pleasant hillside.
It is only human nature; and, for a person. who lacks a total
view of the ecology of the land, it seems the most obvious and
sensible thing to do. If you are going to build a building,
" ... build it in the best possible place."
But think now of the three-guarters of the available land
which are not guite so nice. Since people always build on the onequarter
which is healthiest, the other three-quarters, already less
healthy ecologically, become neglected. Gradually, they become
BUILDINGS
less and less healthy. Who is ever going to do anything on that
corner of the lot which is dark and dank, where the garbage
accumulates, or that part of the land which is a stagnant swamp,
or the dry, stony hillside, where no plants are growing
Not only that. When we build on the best parts of the land,
those beauties which are there already-the crocuses that break
through the lawn each spring, the sunny pile of stones where
lizards sun themselves, the favorite gravel path, which we love
walking on-it is alw;iys these things which get lost in the shuffie.
When the construction starts on the parts of the land which are
already healthy, innumerable beauties are wiped out with every
act of building.
People always say to themselves, well, of course, we can always
start another garden, build another trellis, put in another gravel
path, put new crocuses in the new lawn, and the lizards will find
some other pile of stones. But it just is not so. These simple things
take years to grow-it isn't all that easy to create them, just by
wanting to. And every time we disturb one of these precious
details, it may take twenty years, a lifetime even, before some
comparable details grow again from our small daily acts.
If we always build on that part of the land which is most
healthy, we can be virtually certain that a great deal of the land
will always be less than healthy. If we want the land to be healthy
all over-all of it-then we must do the opposite. We must treat
every new act of building as an opportunity to mend some rent in
the existing cloth; each act of building gives us the chance to
make one of the ugliest and least healthy parts of the environment
more healthy-as for those parts which are already healthy
and beautiful-they of course need no attention. And in fact, we
must discipline ourselves most strictly to leave them alone, so
that our energy actually goes to the places which need it. This is
the principle of site repair.
The fact is, that current development hardly ever does well
by this pattern: everyone has a story about how some new building
or road destroyed a place dear to them. The following news
article from the San Francisco Chronicle February , 73 headlined
"Angry Boys Bulldoze House" struck us as the perfect case:
Two  -year old boys-enraged over a swath of suburban homes
being built in the midst of their rabbit-hunting turf-were arrested

I  SITE REPAIR
after they admitted flattening one of the homes with a purloined
bulldozer.
According to the Washoe County sheriff's office, the youths started
up a bulldozer used at the construction site about four miles north
of Reno, then plowed the sturdy vehicle through one of the homes
four times late last Friday night.
The ranch-style house-which was nearly completed-was a
shambles when workmen arrived yesterday morning. Damage was
estimated at $   by the contractor. One of the boys told authorities
the home along with several others nearby was ruining a
"favorite rabbit-hunting preserve."
The two boys were booked on charges of felonious destruction.
The idea of site repair is just a beginning. It deals with the
problem of how to minimize damage. But the most talented of
traditional builders have always been able to use built form, not
only to avoid damage, but also to improve the natural landscape.
This attitude is so profoundly different from our current view of
building, that concepts which will help us decide how to place
buildings to improve the landscape don't even exist yet.
Therefore:
On no account place buildings in the places which are
most beautiful. In fact, do the opposite. Consider the site
and its buildings as a single living eco-system. Leave those
areas that are the most precious, beautiful, comfortable,
and healthy as they are, and build new structures in those
parts of the site which are least pleasant now.

if it isn't, in all but desert climates.
This is perhaps the most important single fact about a building.
If the building is placed right, the building and its gardens will
be happy places foll of activity and laughter. If it is done wrong,
then all the attention in the world, and the most beatitiful details,
will not prevent it from being a silent gloomy place.
Thousands of acres of open space in every city are wasted because
they are north of buildings and never get the sun. This is true
for public buildings, and it is true for private houses. The recently
built Bank of America building in San Francisco-a giant building
built by a major firm of architects-has its plaza on the
north side. At lunchtime, the plaza is empty, and people eat
their sandwiches in the street, on the south side where the sun is.
North facing outdoors.
Just so for small private houses. The shape and orientation of
lots common in most developments force houses to be surrounded
by open space which no one will ever use because it isn't in the
sun.
A survey of a residential block in Berkeley, California, confirms
this problem dramatically. Along Webster Street-an eastwest
street- of  persons interviewed said they used only the
sunny part of their yards. Half of these were people living on
 SOUTH FACING OUTDOORS
the north side of the street-these people did not we their backyards
at all, but would sit in the front yard, beside the sidewalk,
to be in the south sun. The north-facing back yards were used
primarily for storing junk. '\Jot one of the persons interviewed
indicated preference for a shady yard.
Favorite outdoor places to the sout!t.
The survey also gave credence to the idea that sunny areas
won't be used if there is a deep band of shade up against the
house, through which you must pass to get to the sun. Four
north facing backyards were large enough to be sunny toward
the rear. In only one of these yards was the sunny area reported
as being used-in j LlSt the one where it was possible to get to the
sun without passing through a deep band of shade.
Although the idea of south-facing open space is simple, it has
great consequences, and there will have to be major changes in
land use to make it come right. For example, residential neighborhoods
would have to be organized quite differently from the
way they are laid out today. Private lots would have to be longer
north to south, with the houses on the north side.
Blocks reorganized to catch the sun.

Note that this pattern was developed in the San Francisco Bay
Area. Of course, its significance varies as latitude and climate
change. In Eugene, Oregon, for example, with a rather rainy
climate, at about 0° latitude, the pattern is even more essential:
the south faces of the buildings are the most valuable outdoor
spaces on sunny days. In desert climates, the pattern is less important;
people will want to stay in outdoor spaces that have a
balance of sun and shade. But remember that in one way or
another, this pattern is absolutely fundamental.
Therefore:
Always place buildings to the north of the outdoor spaces
that go with them, and keep the outdoor spaces to the south.
Never leave a deep band of shade between the building and
the sunny part of the outdoors.

choose the place to build, and also choose the place for the outdoors.
You cannot shape the one without the other. This pattern
gives you the geometric character of the outdoors; the next oneWINGS
OF LIGHT  07)-gives you the complementary shape of
the indoors.
Outdoor spaces which are merely "left over" between
buildings will, in general, not be used.
There are two fundamentally different kinds of outdoor
space: negative space and positive space. Outdoor space is negative
when it is shapeless, the residue left behind when buildingswhich
are generally viewed as positive-are placed on the land.
An outdoor space is positive when it has a distinct and definite
shape, as definite as the shape of a room, and when its shape is as
important as the shapes of the buildings which surround it.
These two kinds of space have entirely different plan geometries,
which may be most easily distinguished by their figure-ground
reversal.

If you look at the plan of an environment where outdoor

figure against the ground of the buildings. The plans have
figure-ground reversal.
Another way of defining the difference between "positive"
and "negative" outdoor spaces is by their degree of enclosure and
their degree of convexity.
In mathematics, a space is convex when a line joining any two
points inside the space itself lies totally inside the space. It is
nonconvex, when some lines joining two points lie at least partly
outside the space. According to this definition, the following
irregular squarish space is convex and therefore positive; but the
L-shaped space is not convex or positive, because the line joining
its two end points cuts across the corner and therefore goes
outside the space.
Convex and nonconvex.
Positive spaces are partly enclosed, at least to the extent that
their areas seem bounded  even though they are not, in fact,
because there are always paths leading out, even whole sides
open), and the "virtual" area which seems to exist is convex.
Negative spaces are so poorly defined that you cannot really tell
where their boundaries are, and to the extent that you can tell,
the shapes are nonconvex. r,
T !tis space can be felt: it is distinct :-a place . . . and
it is convex. This space is vague, amorphow, "nothing."
Now, what is the functional relevance of the distinction between
"positive" and "negative" outdoor spaces. We put forward
the following hypothesis. People feel comfortable in spaces which
are "positive" and use these spaces; people feel ·elatively uncomfo,
·table in spacer which a,·e "negative" and such spaces tend
to remain unused.
DUILDINGS
The case for this hypothesis has been most fully argued by
Camillo Sitte, in City Planning According to Artistic Principles
(republished by Random House in 65). Sitte has analyzed a
very large number of European city squares, distinguishing those
which seem used and lively from those which don't, trying to account
for the success of the lively squares. He shows, with example
after example, that the successful ones-those which are greatly
used and enjoyed-have two properties. On the one hand, they
are partly enclosed; on the other hand, they are also open to one
another, so that each one leads into the next.
The fact that people feel more comfortable in a space which
is at least partly enclosed is hard to explain. To begin with, it is
obviously not always true. For example, people feel very comfortable
indeed on an open beach, or on a rolling plain, where
there may be no enclosure at all. But in the smaller outdoor spaces
-gardens, parks, walks, plazas-enclosure does, for some reason,
seem to create a feeling of security.
T t seems likely that the need for enclosure goes back to our most
Four examples of positive outdoor space.

I POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE
primitive instincts. For example, when a person looks for a place
to sit down outdoors, he rarely chooses to sit exposed in the
middle of an open space--he usually looks for a tree to put his
back against; a hollow in the ground, a natural cleft which will
partly enclose and shelter him. Our studies of people's space
needs in workplaces show a similar phenomenon. To be comfortable,
a person wants a certain amount of enclosure around him
and his work-but not too much-see WORKSPACE ENCLOSURE
(183). Clare Cooper has found the same thing in her study of
parks: people seek areas which are partially enclosed and partly
open-not too open, not too enclosed Clare Cooper, Open
Space Study, San Francisco Urban Design Study, San Francisco
City Planning Dept., 69).
Most often, positive outdoor space is created at the same time
that other patterns are created. The following photograph shows
one of the few places in the world where a considerable amount
of building had no other purpose whatsoever except to create
a positive outdoor space. It somehow underlines the pattern's
urgency.
The square at Nancy.
When open space is negative, for example, L-shaped-it is
always possible to place small buildings, or building projections,
or walls in such a way as to break the space into positive pieces.

And when an existing open space is too enclosed, it may be

Therefore:
Make all the outdoor spaces which surround and lie
between your buildings positive. Give each one some degree
of enclosure; surround each space with wings of buildings,
trees, hedges, fences, arcades, and trellised walks, until it
becomes an entity with a positive quality and does not spill
out indefinitely around corners.

... at this stage, you have a rough pos1t1on for the building or
buildings on the site from SOUTH FACING OUTDOORS ro5 and
POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE ro6). Before you lay out the interior of
the building in detail, it is necessary to define the shapes of roofs
and buildings in rather more detail. To do this, go back to the
decisions you have already made about the basic social components
of the building. In some cases, you will have made these decisions
according to the individual case; in other cases you may have
used the fundamental social patterns to define the basic entitiesTHE
FAMILY 5), HOUSE FOR A SMALL FAMILY 6), HOUSE FOR
A COUPLE 7), HOUSE FOR ONE PERSON ), SELF-GOVERNING
WORKSHOPS AND OFFICES 0), SMALL SERVICES WITHOUT RED
TAPE 1), OFFICE CONNECTIONS 2), MASTER AND APPRENTICES
(83), INDIVIDUALLY OWNED SHOPS 7). Now it is time to start
giving the building a more definite shape based on these social
groupings. Start by realizing that the building needn't be a massive
hulk, but may be broken into wings.
Modern buildings are often shaped with no concern for
natural light-they depend almost entirely on artificial
light. But buildings which displace natural light as the
major source of illumination are not fit places to spend the
day.
A monster building-no concern for daylight inside.
BUILDINGS
This simple statement, if taken seriously, will make a revolution
in the shape of buildings. At present, people take for granted that
it is possible to use indoor space which is lit by artificial light; and
buildings therefore take on all kinds of shapes and depths.
If we treat the presence of natural light as an essential-not
optional-feature of indoor space, then no building could ever
be more than 0- feet deep, since no point in a building
which is more than about I  or I  feet from a window, can get
good natural light.
Later on, in LIGHT ON TWO SIDES  ), we shall argue, even
more sharply, that every room where people can feel comfortable
must have not merely one window, but two, on different sides.
This adds even further structure to the building shape: it requires
not only that the building be no more than  feet deep, but also
that its outer walls are continually broken up by corners and reentrant
corners to give every room two outside walls.
The present pattern, which requires that buildings be made
up of long and narrow wings, lays the groundwork for the later
pattern. Unless the building is first conceived as being made of
long, thin wings, there is no possible way of introducing LIGHT
ON Two SIDES ), in its complete form, later in the process.
Therefore, we first build up the argument for this pattern, based
on the human requirements for natural light, and later, in LIGHT
ON TWO SIDES  I ), we shall be concerned with the organization
of windows within a particular room.
There are two reasons for believing that people must have
buildings lit essentially by sun.
First, all over the world, people are rebelling against windowless
buildings; people complain when they have to work in
places without daylight. By analyzing words they use, Rapoport
has shown that people are in a more positive frame of mind in
rooms with windows than in rooms without windows. Amos
Rapoport, "Some Consumer Comments on a Designed Environment,"
Arena, January, 67, pp. 6-78. Edward Hall tells
the story of a man who worked in a windowless office for some
time, all the time saying that it was "just fine, just fine," and
then abruptly quit. Hall says, "The issue was so deep, and so
serious, that this man could not even bear to discuss it, since just
discussing it would have opened the floodgates."

 WINGS OF LIGHT
Second, there is a growing body of evidence which suggests
that man actually needs daylight, since the cycle of daylight
somehow plays a vital role in the maintenance of the body's circadian
rhythms, and that the change of light during the day,
though apparently variable, is in this sense a fundamental constant
by which the human body maintains its relationship to the
environment. See, for instance, R. G. Hopkinson, Architectural
Physics: Lighting, Department of Scientific & Industrial Research,
Building Research Station, HMSO, London, 63, pp. l -17.)
If this is true, then too much artificial light actually creates a
rift between a person and his surroundings and upsets the human
physiology.
Many people will agree with these arguments. Indeed, the
arguments merely express precisely what all of us know already:
that it is much more pleasant to be in a building lit by
daylight than in one which is not. But the trouble is that many
of the buildings which are built without daylight are built that
way because of density. They are built compact, in the belief
that it is necessary to sacrifice daylight in order to reach high
densities.
Lionel March and Leslie Martin have made a major contribution
to this discussion. Leslie Martin and Lionel March, Land
Use and Built Form, Cambridge Research, Cambridge University,
April I 66. Using the ratio of built floor area to total site
area as a measure of density and the semi-depth of the building
as a measure of daylight conditions, they have compared three
different arrangements of building and open space, which they
call So, S1, and S2, •• ·:

for a fixed density. It also gives the highest density for a fixed
level of daylight.
There is another criticism that is often leveled against this
pattern. Since it tends to create buildings which are narrow and
rambling, it increases the perimeter of buildings and therefore
raises building cost substantially. How big is the difference? The
following figures are taken from a cost analysis of standard office
buildings used by Skidmore Owings and Merrill, in the program
BOP Building Optimization). These figures illustrate costs for
a typical floor of an office building and are based on costs of
 I dollars per square foot for the structure, floors, finishes, mechanical,
and so on, not including exterior wall, and a cost of
I IO dollars per running foot for the perimeter wall. Costs arc
for 69.)

The extra perimeter adds little to building costs.
We see then, that at least in this one case, the cost of the extra
perimeter adds very little to the cost of the building. The narrowest
building costs only  per cent more than the squarest. We
believe this case is fairly typical and that the cost savings to be
achieved by square and compact building forms have been greatly
exaggerated.
Now, assuming that this pattern is compatible with the problems
of density and perimeter cost, we must decide how wide a
building can be, and still be essentially lit by the sun.
We assume, first of all, that no point in the building should
have less than  lumens per square foot of illumination. This is
the level found in a typical corridor and is just below the level required
for reading. We assume, second, that a place will only
seem "naturally" lit, if more than  o per cent of its light comes
from the sky: that is, even the points furthest from the windows
must be getting at least IO lumens per square foot of their illumination
from the sky.
 WINGS OF LIGHT
Let ns now look at a room analyzed in detail by Hopkinson and
Kay. The room, a classroom, is I  feet deep,  feet wide, with
a window all along one side starting three feet above the floor.
Walls have a reflectance of  per cent-a fairly typical value.
With a standard sky, the desks I  feet from the window are just
getting IO lumens per square foot from the sky-onr minimum.
Yet this is a rather well lit room. R. G. Hopkinson and J. G. Kay,
The Lighting of Buildings, New York: Praeger, 69, p. 08).
It is hard to imagine then, that many rooms more than I  feet
deep will meet our standards. Indeed, m:rny patterns in th is book
will tend to reduce the window area-WINDOWS OVERLOOKING
LIFE 2), NATURALD OORSA NUW INDOW(S 1), DEEP RF.VEALS
(223), SMALi. PANES ), so that in many cases rooms should
be no more than I  feet deep-more only if the walls are very
light or the ceilings very high. We conclude, therefore, that a
building wing that is truly a "wing of light" must be about
feet wide-never wider than  feet-with the interior rooms
"one deep" along the wing. When buildings are wider than this,
artificial light, of necessity, takes over.
A building which simply has to be wide-a large hall for
example-can have the proper ]eve] of natural light if there are
extra clerestory windows in the roof.
Therefore:
Arrange each building so that it breaks down into wings
which correspond, approximately, to the most important
natural social groups within the building. Make each wing
long and as narrow as you can-never more than  feet
wide.
wings  feet wide max.

Use the wings to form outdoor areas which have a definite
shape, like courts and rooms-POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE  I 06 ;
connect the wings, whenever possible, to the existing buildings
round about so that the building takes its place within a long

When you get further down and start defining individual
rooms, make use of the daylight which the wings provide by giving
each room LIGHT ON TWO SIDES   ).
Give each wing its own roof in such a way that all the wings
together form a great cascade of roofs-CASCADE OF ROOFS II  ;
if the wing contains various houses, or workgroups, or a sequence

I  CONNECTED BUILDINGS
When buildings are isolated and free standing, it is of course
not necessary for the people who own them, use them, and repair
them to interact with one another at all. By contrast, in a town
where buildings lean against each other physiolly, the sheer
fact of their adjacency forces people to confront their neighbors,
forces them to solve the myriad of little problems which occur
between them, forces them to learn how to adapt to other people's
foibles, forces them to learn how to adapt to the realities outside
them, which are greater, and more impenetrable than they are.
Not only is it true that connected buildings have these healthy
consequences and that isolated buildings have unhealthy ones. It
seems very likely-though we have no evidence to prove itthat,
in fact, isolated buildings have become so popular, so automatic,
so taken for granted in our time, because people seek refuge
from the need to confront their neighbors, refuge from the need
to work out common problems. In this sense, the isolated buildings
are not only symptoms of withdrawal, but they also perpetuate
and nurture the sickness.
If this is so, it is literally not too much to say that in those
parts of town where dei;sities are relatively high, isolated
buildings, and the laws which create and enforce them, are
undermining the fabric of society as forcibly and as persistently as
any other social evil of our time.
By contrast, Sitte gives a beautiful discussion, with many
examples, of the normal way that buildings were connected in
ancient times:
The result is indeed astonishing, since from amongst  churches:
 have one side attached to other buildings
 have two sides attached to other buildings
  o have three sides attached to other buildings
 have four sides obstructed by other buildings
· are free standing
 churches in all; only  free-standing.
Regarding Rome then, it can be taken as a rule that churches
were never erected as free-standing structures. Almost the same is
true, in fact, for the whole of Italy. As is becoming clear, our modern
attitude rnns precisely contrary to this well-integrated and obviously
thought-out procedure. We do not seem to think it possible that a
new church can be located anywhere except in the middle of its
building lot, so that there is space all around it. But this placement
offers only disadvantages and not a single advantage. It is the least

... this pattern helps to complete BUILDING COMPLEX 5),
WINGS OF LIGHT 07), and POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE 06).
It helps to create positive outdoor space, especially, by eliminating
all the wasted areas between buildings. As you connect each building
to the next you will find that you nuke the outdoor space
positive, almost instinctively.
Isolated buildings are symptoms of a disconnected sick
society.
Even in medium and higl density areas where buildings are
very close to each other and where there are strong reasons to
connect them in a single fabric, people still insist on building
isolated structures, witl little bits of useless space around them.
T/,ese buildings pretend to be independent of one anotherand
this pretense leads to weless space around them.
Indeed, in our time, isolated, free-standing buildings are so
common, that we have learned to take them for granted, without
realizing that all the psycho-social disintegration of society is
embodied in the fact of rheir existence.
It is easiest to understand this at the emotional level. The
house, in dreams, most often means the self or person of the
dreamer. A town of disconnected buildings, in a dream, would
be a picture of society, made up of disconnected, isolated, selves.
And the real towns which have this form, like dreams, embody
just this meaning: they perpetuate the arrogant assumption that
people stand alone and exist independently of one another.

 LONG THIN HOUSE*
. . . for a very small house or office the pattern of WINGS OF
LIGHT rn6 is almost automatically solved-no one would imagine
that the house should be more than   feet wide. But in
such a house or office there are strong reasons to make the building
even longer and thinner still. "This pattern was originally
formulated by Christie Coffin.
The shape of a building has a great effect on the relative
degrees of privacy and overcrowding in it, and this in turn
has a critical effect on people's comfort and well being.
There is widespread evidence to show that overcrowding in
small dwellings causes psychological and social damage. For
example, Wiliam C. Loring, "Housing Characteristics and Social
Disorganization," Social Problems, January 56; Chombart
de Lauwe, Famille et Habitation, Editions du Centre National
de la Recherche Scientifique, Paris, 59; Bernard Lander,
Towards an Understanding of Juvenile Delinquency, New York:
Columbia University Press, 54. Everyone seems to be on top
of everyone else. Everything seems to be too near everything else.
Privacy for individuals or couples is almost impossible.
It would be simple to solve these problems by providing more
space-but space is expensive, and it is usually impossible to buy
more than a certain very limited amount of it. So the question is:
For a given fixed area, which shape will create the greatest
feeling of spaciousness?
There is a mathematical answer to this question.
The feeling of overcrowding is largely created by the mean
point-to-point distances inside a building. In a small house these
distances are small-as a result it is not possible to walk far inside
the house nor to get away from annoying disturbances; and it is
hard to get away from noise sources, even when they are in other
rooms.

BUILDINGS
To reduce this effect the building should have a shape for
which the mean point-to-point distance is high. For any given
shape, we may compute the mean or average distance between
two randomly chosen points within the shape). The mean pointto-
point distance is low in compact shapes like circles and squares,
and high in those distended shapes like long thin rectangles, and
branched shapes, and tall narrow towers. These shapes increase
the separation between places inside the building and therefore
increase the relative privacy which people are able to get within
a given area.
llOd
R 1ildings which increase t!te distance between points.
Of course, in practice there are limits on the long-thinness of
a building. If it is too long and thin, the cost of walls becomes
prohibitive, the cost of heating is too high, and the plan is not
useful. But this is still no reason to settle only for box-like
forms.
A small building can actually be much narrower than people
imagine. It can certainly be much narrower than the   foot
width proposed in WINGS OF LIGHT  I 07). We have seen successful
buildings as narrow as  feet wide-indeed, Richard Neutra's
own house in Los Angeles is even less.
Long thin !touses.

 LONG THIN HOUSE
And a long thin house can also be a tower, or a pair of towers,
connected at ground level. Towers, like floors can be much
narrower than people realize. A building which is I  feet sguare,
and three stories high, with an exterior stair, makes a wonderful
house. The rooms are so far apart, psychologically, that you feel
as if you are in a mansion.
A Russian tower.
Therefore:
In small buildings, don't cluster all the rooms together
around each other; instead string out the rooms one after
another, so that distance between each room is as great
as it can be. You can do this horizontally-so that the plan
becomes a thin, long rectangle; or you can do it vertically
-so that the building becomes a tall narrow tower. In
either case, the building can be surprisingly narrow and
still work-8, 0, and  feet are all quite possible.

... you have a rough pos1t1on for your building on the siteSITE
REPAIR 04), SOUTH FACING OUTDOORS !05), WINGS OF
LIGHT 07). You also have an idea of the major circulation in
the building complex and the lines of approach which lead
toward the building-crncuLATION REALMS  8), FAMILY OF
ENTRANCES 02). Now it is time to fix the entrance of the
building.

Placing the main entrance or main entrances is perhaps
the single most important step you take during the evolution
of a building plan.
The pos1t1on of main entrances controls the layout of the
building. It controls movement to and from the building, and all
the other decisions about layout flow from this decision. When
the entrances are placed correctly, the layout of the building unfolds
naturally and simply; when the entrances are badly placed,
the rest of the building never seems quite right. It is therefore
vital that the position of the main entrance or entrances be
made early and correctly.
The functional problem which guides the placing of main entrances
is simple. T!te entrance must be placed in suc!t a way
t!tat people w!to approach t!te bu/ding see t!te entrance or some
!tint of w!tere t!te entrance is, as soon as t!tey see t!te building
itself. This makes it possible for them to orient their movements
toward the entrance as soon as they start moving toward the building,
without having to change direction or change their plan of
how they will approach the building.
The functional problem is rather obvious, but it is hard to
overestimate the contribution it makes to a good building. We
have had the experience over and again, that un ti] this question
is settled and an appropriate position chosen, a project is at a
stalemate. And conversely, once the main entrances have been
located and they can be felt to be in the right position, then
other decisions begin to come naturally. This is true for single

BUILDINGS
houses, house clusters, small public buildings, large complexes of
public buildings. Apparently, the pattern is basic, no matter the
scale of the building.
Let us look into the functional question in more detail. Everyone
finds it annoying to search around a building, or a precinct of
buildings, looking for the proper entrance. When you know just
where the entrance is, you don't have to bother thinking about
it. It's automatic-you walk in, thinking about whatever's on
your mind, looking at whatever catches your eye-you are not
forced to pay attention to the environment simply to get around.
Yet the entrances to many buildings are hard to find; they are
not "automatic" in this sense.
There are two steps to solving the problem. First, the main
entrances must be placed correctly. Second, they must be shaped
so they are clearly visible.
I. Position
Consciously or unconsciously, a person walking works out his
path some distance ahead, so as to take the shortest path. See
Tyrus Porter, A Study of Path Choosing Behavior, thesis, University
of California, Berkeley, I 64). If the entrance is not
visible when the building itself becomes visible, he cannot work
out his path. To be able to work out his path, he must be able
to see the entrance early, as soon as he sees the building.
And for other reasons too, the entrance needs to be the first
thing that you come to. If you have to walk a long distance along
the building before you can enter, the chances arc high that you
will have to turn back after entering, and walk back in the direction
you came from. This is not only annoying, but you may even
begin to wonder whether you are going the right way and
whether you haven't perhaps even missed the proper entrance. It
is hard to pin this down numerically, but we suggest a threshold
of some  feet. No one is bothered by a detour of  feet; if it
gets much longer, it begins to be annoying.
Therefore, the first step in placing the entrances is to consider
the main lines of approach to the site. Locate entrances so that,
once the building(s come into view, the entrance, too, comes into
view; and the path toward the entrance is not more than  feet
along the building.

I IO MAIN ENTRANCE
Entrance position.
 Shape
A person approaching a building needs to see the entrance
clearly. Yet many of the people approaching the building are
walking along the front of the building and parallel to it. Their
angle of approach is acute. From this angle, many entrances are
hardly visible. An entrance will be visible from an acute angled
approach if:
a. The entrance sticks out beyond the building line.
b. The building is higher around the entrance, and this height
is visible along the approach.
Entrance shape.

BUILDINGS
And of course, the relative color of the entrance, the light and
shade immediately around it, the presence of mouldings and ornaments,
may all play a part too. But above all, it is important that
the entrance be strongly differentiated from its immediate surroundings.
Therefore:
Place the main entrance of the building at a point where
it can be seen immediately from the main avenues of approach
and give it a bold, visible shape which stands out in
front of the building.

If possible, make the entrance one of a family of similar entrances,
so that they all stand out as visibly as possible within the
street or building complex-FAMILY OF ENTRANCES  !02); build

... this pattern helps to form the fundamental layout of HOUSE

influences the relative position of the buildings and their gardens.
Since it affects the position of the buildings, and the shape and
position of the gardens, it can also be used to help create SOUTH
FACING OUTDOORS 05 and to help the general process of SITE
REPAIR  !04),

If a garden is too close to the street, people won't use it
because it isn't private enough. But if it is too far from the
street, then it won't be used either, because it is too isolated.
Start by thinking about the front garderis which you know.
They are often decorative, lawns, flowers. But how often are
people sitting there? Except at those special moments, when
people want specifically to be watching the street, the front garden
is nothing but a decoration. The half-private family groups,
drinks with friends, playing ball with the children, lying in the
grass-these need more protection than the typical front garden
can create.
And the back gardens do not really solve the problem either.
Those back gardens which are entirely isolated, entirely "in back"
-are so remote from the street, that people often don't feel
comfortable there either. Often the back garden is so remote from
the street, that you can't hear people coming to the house; you
have no sense of any larger, more open space, no sense of other
people-only the enclosed, isolated, fenced-in world of one family.
Children, so much more spontaneous and intuitive, give us a view
in microcosm. How rarely they play in the full back garden;
how much more often they prefer these side yards and gardens
which have some privacy, yet also some exposure to the street.

BUILDINGS
It seems then, that the proper place for a garden is neither in
front, nor fully behind, The garden needs a certain degree of
privacy, yet also wants some kind of tenuous connection to the
street and entrance. This balance can only be created in a situation
where the garden is half in front, half in back-in a word,
at the side, protected by a wall from too great an exposure to the
street; and yet open enough, through paths, gates, arcades,
trellises, so that people in the garden still have a glimpse of the
street, a view of the front door or the path to the front door.
All this requires a revolution in the normal conception of a
"lot." Lots are usually narrow along the street and deep. But to
create half-hidden gardens, the lots must be long along the street,
and shallow, so that each house can have a garden at its side, This
gives the following archetype for house and half hidden.
Archetype of a half-hidden garden.
There are many ways of developing this idea. One version we
experienced in an old house where we once had our offices was
particularly interesting.

III HALF-HIDDEN GARDEN
The garden that we used was to the back, but behind the nextdoor
house. It worked perfectly as a half-hidden garden for our
house. We were able to sit there privately and have our lunch,
and work on warm days, and still be in touch with the main
entrance and even a glimpse of the street. But our own back
garden was entirely hidden-and we never used it.
Therefore:
Do not place the garden fully in front of the house, nor
fully to the back. Instead, place it in some kind of half-way
position, side-by-side with the house, in a position which
is half-hidden from the street, and half-exposed.
fentrance
If possible, use this pattern to influence the shape of house lots
too, and make them as near double squares along the street as
possible; build a partial wall around the garden, and locate the entrance
to the house between the house and the garden, so that
people in the garden can be private, yet still aware of the street,
and aware of anybody coming up to the house-MAIN ENTRANCE
( I Io), GARDEN WALL  I 3 ; allow the garden to grow wildGARDEN
GROWING WILD 2), and make the passage through, or
alongside it, a major part of the transition between street and
house-ENTRANCE TRANSITION  I I z). Half-hid den gardens may

I I  ENTRANCE TRANSITION**

... whatever kind of building or building complex you are
making, you have a rough position for its major entrances-the
gateways to the site from MAIN GATEWAYS 3); the entrances to
individual buildings from FAMILY OF ENTRANCES  02), MAIN
ENTRANCE  I 0). In every case, the entrances create a transition
between the "outside"-the public world-and some less
public inner world. If you have HALF-HIDDEN GARDENS   I I)
the gardens help to intensify the beauty of the transition. This
pattern now elaborates and reinforces the transition which entrances
and gardens generate.
Buildings, and especially houses, with a graceful transition
between the street and the inside, are more tranquil
than those which open directly off the street.
The experience of entering a building influences the way you
feel inside the building. If the transition is too abrupt there is
no feeling of arrival, and the inside of the building fails to be
an inner sanctum.
An ab,·upt entrance-no transition.
The following argument may help to explain it. While people
are on the street, they adopt a style of "street behavior." When
they come into a house they naturally want to get rid of this
street behavior and settle down completely into the more intimate
spirit appropriate to a house. But it seems likely that they cannot
do this unless there is a transition from one to the other which

BUILDINGS
helps them to lose the street behavior. The transition must, in
effect, destroy the momentum of the closedness, tension and "distance"
which are appropriate to street behavior, before people can
relax completely.
Evidence comes from the report by Robert Weiss and Serge
Boutcrline, Fain, Exhibits, Pavilions, and their Audiences, Cambridge,
Mass., 62. The authors noticed that many exhibits
failed to "hold" people; people drifted in and then drifted out
again within a very short time. However, in one exhibit people
had to cross a huge, deep-pile, bright orange carpet on the way
in. In th is case, though the exhibit was no better than other
exhibits, people stayed. The authors concluded that people were,
in general, under the influence of their own "street and crowd
behavior," and that while under this influence could not relax
enough to make contact with the exhibits. But the bright carpet
presented them with such a strong contrast as they walked in,
that it broke the effect of their outside behavior, in effect "wiped
them clean," with the result that they could then get absorbed
in the exhibit.
Michael Christiano, while a student at the University of California,
made the following experiment. He showed people photographs
and drawings of house entrances with varying degrees
of transition and tl1en asked them which of these had the most
"houseness." He found that the more changes ai1d transitions a
house entrance has, the more it seems to be "houselike." And the
entrance which was judged most houselike of all is one which is
approached by a long open sheltered gallery from which there
is a view into the distance.
There is another argument which helps to explain the importance
of the transition: people want their house, and especially the
entrance, to be a private domain. If the front door is set back, and
there is a transition space between it and the street, this domain
is well established. This would explain why people are often
unwilling to go without a front lawn, even though they do not
"use it." Cyril Bird found that  per cent of the inhabitants of a
housing project said their front gardens, which were some 0
feet deep, were j L1Srt ight or even too small-yet only  per cent
of them ever used the gardens as a place to sit. "Reactions to
Radburn: A Study of Radburn Type Housing, in Heme] Hempstead,"
RIBA final thesis, I 60.)

I I  ENTRANCE TRANSITION
So far we have spoken mainly about houses. But we believe
this pattern applies to a wide variety of entrances. It certainly
applies to all dwellings including apartments-even though it is
usually missing from apartments today. It also applies to those
public buildings which thrive on a sense of seclusion from the
world: a clinic, a jewelry store, a church, a public library. It does
not apply to public buildings or any buildings which thrive on
the fact of being continuous with the public world.
Here are four examples of successful entrance transitions.
Each creates the transition with a different
combination of elements.
As you see from these examples, it is possible to make the transition
itself in many different physical ways. In some cases, for
example, it may be just inside the front door-a kind of entry
court, leading to another door or opening that is more definitely
inside. In another case, the transition may be formed by a bend
in the path that takes you through a gate and brushes past the
fuchsia on the way to the door. Or again, you ·might create a tran-
  I
BUILDINGS
s1t10n by changing the texture of the path, so that you step off
the sidewalk onto a gravel path and then up a step or two and
under a trellis.
In all these cases, what matters most is that the transition
exists, as an actual physical place, between the outside and the
inside, and that the view, and sounds, and light, and surface
which you walk on change as you pass through this place. It is the
physical changes-and above all the change of view-which
creates the psychological transition in your mind.
Therefore:
Make a transition space between the street and the front
door. Bring the path which connects street and entrance
through this transition space, and mark it with a change of
light, a change of sound, a change of direction, a change of
surface, a change of level, perhaps by gateways which make
a change of enclosure, and above all with a change of view.

runs right up to the front door, up to the ENTRANCE ROOM

I I  CAR CONNECTION

... once you have the entrance of the building fixed and its
transition clear-MAIN ENTRANCE  I IO) ENTRANCE TRANSITION
(II )-it is necessary to work out how a person can approach
the building by car. Of course, in a pedestrian precinct this will
not apply; but generally the car itself must have a housing somewhere
near the building; and when this is so, its place and
character are critical.

The process of arnvmg in a house, and leaving it, is
fundamental to our daily lives; and very often it involves
a car. But the place where cars connect to houses, far from
being important and beautiful, is often off to one side
and neglected.
This neglect can wreck havoc with the circulation in the
house, especially in those houses with the traditional "front door
and back door" relationship. Both family and visitors tend, more
and more, to come and go by car. Since people always try to use
the door nearest the car see Vere Hole, et al., "Studies of 00
Houses in Conventional and Radburn Layouts," Building Research
Station, Carston, Herts, England, I 66), the entrance
nearest the parking spot always becomes the "main" entrance,
even if it was not planned that way.

IIJ CAR CONNECTION
If this entrance is a "back" door, then the back of the house
becomes less a sanctuary for the family and perhaps the housewife
feels uncomfortable about guests traipsing through. On the other
hand, if this entrance is a formal "front" door, it is not really
appropriate for family and good friends. In Radburn, the back
doors face the parking lot, and the front doors face a pedestrian
green. For families with cars, the back door, being on the car
side, dominates exit and entry, yet visitors are "supposed" to
come to the front door.
In order to ensure that both the kitchen and formal living room
are conveniently located with respect to cars and that each space
maintains its integrity in terms of use and privacy, there must be
one and only one primary entrance into the house, and the
kitchen and living room must be both directly accessible from
this entrance. We do not mean that a house needs to have only
one entrance. There is no reason why a house cannot have
several entrances-indeed there are good reasons why it probably
should have more than one. Secondary entrances, like patio and
garden doors and teenager's private entrances, are very important.
But they should never be placed so that they are in between the
main entrance and the natural place to arrive by car-otherwise,
they will compete with the main entrance and, again, confuse the
way the house plan works.
Finally, it is essential to make something of the space which
connects the house and the car, to make it a positive space-a
space which supports the experience of coming and going. Essentially
this means making a room out of the place for the car,
the path from the car door to the house, and the front door. It
may be achieved with columns, low walls, the edge of the house,
plants, a trellised walk, a place to sit. This is the place we call the
CAR CONNECTION II ). A proper car connection is a place where
people can walk together, lean, say goodbye; perhaps it is integrated
with the structure and form of the house.
An ancient inn, built in the days of coach and horses, has a
layout which treats the coach as a fundamental part of the environment
and makes the connection between the two a significant
part of the inn-so much so that it gives the inn its character.
Airports, boathouses, stables, railway stations, all do the same.
But for some reason, even though the car is so important to the

BUILDINGS
way of life in a modern house, the place where car and house
meet is almost never treated seriously as a beautiful and significant
place in its own right.
Therefore:
Place the parking place for the car and the main entrance,
in such a relation to each other, that the shortest
route from the parked car into the house, both to the
kitchen and to the living rooms, is always through the
main entrance. Make the parking place for the car into an
actual room which makes a positive and graceful place
where the car stands, not just a gap in the terrain.

I I  HIERARCHY OF
OPEN SPACE*

... the main outdoor spaces are given their character by SITE
REPAIR 04), SOUTH FACING OUTDOORS 05 and POSITIVE
OUTDOOR SPACE  06). But you can refine them, and complete
their character by making certain that every space always has a
view out into some other larger one, and that all the spaces work
together to form hierarchies.
Outdoors, people always try to find a spot where they
can have their backs protected, looking out toward some
larger opening, beyond the space immediately in front of
them.
In short, people do not sit facing brick walls-they place themselves
toward the view or toward whatever there is in the distance
that comes nearest to a view.
Simple as this observation is, there is almost no more basic
statement to make about the way people place themselves in space.
And this observation has enormous implications for the spaces in
which people can feel comfortable. Essentially, it means that any
plac  where people can feel comfortable has

 A view into a larger space.
In order to understand the implications of this pattern, let us
look at the three major cases where it applies.
In the very smallest of outdoor spaces, in private gardens, this
pattern tells you to make a corner of the space as a "back" with a
seat, looking out on the garden. If it is rightly made, this corner
will be snug, but not at all claustrophobic.

I  HIERARCHY OF OPEN SPACE
Slightly larger in scale, there is the connection between a terrace
or an outdoor room of some kind and a larger open space, the
street or a square. The most common form of the pattern at this
scale is the front stoop, which forms a definite enclosure and a
back, off the public street.
Terrace and street or square,
At the largest scale, this pattern tells you to open up public
squares and greens, at one end, to great vistas. At this scale, the
square itself acts as a kind of back which a person can occupy, and
from which he can look out upon an even larger expanse.

Therefore:
Whatever space you are shaping-whether it is a garden,
terrace, street, park, public outdoor room, or courtyard,
make sure of two things. First, make at least one smaller
space, which looks into it and forms a natural back for it.
Second, place it, and its openings, so that it looks into at
least one larger space.
When you have done this, every outdoor space will have

I I  COURTYARDS
WHICH LIVE**
... within the general scheme of outdoor spaces, made positive
according to the patterns POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE  I 06 and
HIERARCHY OF OPEN SPACE  I ), it is necessary to pay special
attention to those smallest ones, less than  or  feet acrossthe
courtyards-because it is especially easy to make them in such
a way that they do not live.
The courtyards built in modern buildings are very often
dead. They are intended to be private open spaces for
people to use-but they end up unused, full of gravel and
abstract sculptures.
Dead courtyard.
There seem to be three distinct ways in which these courtyards
fail.
r. There is too little ambiguity between indoors and outdoors.
If the walls, sliding doors, doors which lead from the indoors to
the outdoors, are too abrupt, then there is no opportunity for a
person to find himself half way between the two-and then, on
the impulse of a second, to drift toward the outside. People need
an ambiguous in-between realm-a porch, or a veranda, which
they naturally pass onto often, as part of their ordinary life
within the house, so that they can drift naturally to the outside.
 There are not enough doors into the courtyard. If there is
just one door, then the courtyard never lies between two activities
inside the house; and so people are never passing through it, and
enlivening it, while they go about their daily business. To overcome
this, the courtyard should have doors on at least two op-

posite sides, so that it becomes a meeting point for different
activities, provides access ro chem, provides overflow from them,
and provides the cross-circulation between them.
 They are too enclosed. Courtyards which are pleasant to
be in always seem to have "loopholes" which allow you to see
beyond them into some larger, further space. The courtyard
should never be perfectly enclosed by the rooms which surround
it, but should give at least a glimpse of some other space beyond.
Here are several examples of courtyards, large and small, from
various parts of the world, which are alive.
Courlyards wl,icl, live.
Each one is partly open to the activity of the building that
surrounds it and yet still private. A person passing through the
courtyard and children running by can all be glimpsed and felt,
but they are not disruptive. Again, notice that all these courtyards
have strong connections to other spaces. The photographs do
not tell the whole story; but still, you can see that the courtyards
look out, along paths, through the buildings, to larger spaces.
And most spectacular, notice the many different positions that
one can take up in each courtyard, depending on mood and
climate. There are covered places, places in the sun, places
BUILDINGS
spotted with filtered light, places to lie on the ground, places
where a person c:in sleep. The edge and the corners of the courtprds
are ambiguous and richly textured; in some places the
walls of the buildings open, and connect the courtyard with the
inside of the building, directly.
Therefore:
Place every courtyard in such a way that there is a view
out of it to some larger open space; place it so that at
least two or three doors open from the building into it
and so that the natural paths which connect these doors
pass across the courtyard. And, at one edge, beside a door,
make a roofed veranda or a porch, which is continuous
with both the inside and the courtyard.

I I  CASCADE OF ROOFS*
... this pattern helps complete the BUILDING coM PLEX   S),
NUMBER OF STORIES  6), MAIN BUILDING  9), and WINGS OF
LIGHT 07), and it can also be used to help create these
patterns. If you are designing a building from scratch, these
larger patterns have already helped you to decide how high your
buildings are; and they have given you a rough layout, in wings,
with an idea of what spaces there are going to be in each floor of
the wings. Now we come to the stage where it is necessary to
visualize the building as a volume and, therefore, above all else,
as a system of roofs.
Few buildings will be structurally and socially intact, unless
the floors step down toward the ends of wings, and
unless the roof, accordingly, forms a cascade.
TJ1is is a strange pattern. Several problems, from entirely different
spheres, point in the same direction; but there is no
obvious common bond which binds these different problems to
one another-we have not succeeded in seizing the single kernel
which forms the pivot of the pattern.
Let us observe, first, that many beautiful buildings have the
form of a cascade: a tumbling arrangement of wings and lower
wings and smaller rooms and sheds, often with a single highest
center. Hagia Sophia, the Norwegian stave churches, and Palladio's
villas are imposing and magnificent examples. Simple houses, small
Hagia Sophia

I I  CASCADE OF ROOFS
informal building complexes, and even clusters of mud huts are
more modest ones.
What is it that makes the cascading character of these buildings
so sound and so appropriate?
First of all, there is a social meaning in this form. The largest
gathering places with the highest ceilings are in the middle
because they are the social centers of activities; smaller groups of
people, individual rooms, and alcoves fall naturally around the
edges.
Second, there is a structural meaning in the form. Buildings
tend to be of materials that are strong in compression; compressive
strength is cheaper then tensile strength or strength in
bending. Any building which stands in pure compression will
tend toward the overall outline of an inverted catenary-RooF
LAYOUT  09). When a building does take this form, each
outlying space acts to buttress the higher spaces. The building is
stable in just the same way that a pile of earth, which has assumed
the line of least resistance, is also stable.
And third, there is a practical consideration. We shall explain
that ROOF GARDENS II ), wherever they occur, should not be
over the top floor, but always on the same level as the rooms they
serve. This means, naturally, that the building tends to get
lower toward the edges since the roof gardens step down from the
top toward the outer edge of the ground floor.
Why do these three apparently different problems lead to the
same pattern? We don't know. But we suspect that there is some
deeper essence behind the apparent coincidence. We leave the
pattern intact in the hope that someone else will understand its
meaning.
A sketch of Frank Lloyd Wright's.
BUILDINGS
Finally, a note on the application of the pattern. One must
take care, in laying out large buildings, to make the cascade
compatible with WINGS OF LIGHT  07). If you conceive of the
cascade as pyramidal and the building is large, the middle section
of the building will be cut off from daylight. Instead, the proper
synthesis of cascades and wings of light will generate a building
that tumbles down along relatively narrow wings, the wings
turning corners and becoming lower where they will.
Therefore:
Visualize the whole building, or building complex, as a
system of roofs.
Place the largest, highest, and widest roofs over those
parts of the building which are most significant: when you
come to lay the roofs out in detail, you will be able to
make all lesser roofs cascade off these large roofs and form
a stable self-buttressing system, which is congruent with
the hierarchy of social spaces underneath the roofs.
corresponding roofs
cascade
highest in the middle
Make the roofs a combination of steeply pitched or domed, and
flat shapes-SHELTERING ROOF 17), ROOF GARDEN 18). Prepare
to place small rooms at the outside and ends of wings, and
large rooms in the middle-CEILING HEIGHT VARIETY  I 0).
Later, once the plan of the building is more exactly defined, you
can lay out the roofs exactly to fit the cascade to individual rooms;
and at that stage the cascade will begin to have a structural effect
of great importance-STRUCTURE FOLLOWS SOCIAL SPACES   )'
ROOF LAYOUT  09), , , ,

I I  SHELTERING ROOF**
... over the WINGS OF LIGHT  07), within the overall CASCADE
OF ROOFS   ), some parts of the cascade Jre flat and some are
steeply pirched or vaulted. This pattern gives the character of
those parts which are steeply pitched or vaulted; the next one
gives the character of those which must be flat.
The roof plays a primal role in our lives. The most
primitive buildings are nothing but a roof. If the roof is
hidden, if its presence cannot be felt around the building,
or if it cannot be used, then people will lack a fundamental
sense of shelter.
This sheltering function cannot be created by a pitched roof,
or large roof, which is merely added to the top of an existing
structure. The roof itself only shelters if it contains, embraces,
covers, surrounds the process of living. Th is means very simply,
that the roof must not only be large and visible, but ir must also
include living ]Uarters within its volume, not only underneath it.
Compare the following examples. They show clearly how different
roofs are, when they have living quarters within them and
when they don't.
One roof li-ved in, the ot!ter stuck on.
The difference between these tw houses comes largely from
the fact that in one the roof is an integral part of the volume of
the building, while in the other it is no more than a cap that has
been set down on top of the building. In the first case, where the
57°
I  SHELTERING ROOF
building conveys an enormous sense of shelter, it is impossible to
draw a horizontal line across the facade of the building and
separate the roof from the inhabited parts of the building. But in
the second case, the roof is so separate and distinct a thing, that
such a line almost draws itself.
We believe that this connection between the geometry of roofs,
and their capacity to provide psychological shelter, can be put on
empirical grounds: first, there is a kind of evidence which shows
that both children and adults naturally incline toward the
sheltering roofs, almost as if they had archetypal properties. For
example, here is Amos Rapoport on the subject:
... "roof" is a symbol of home, as in the phrase "a roof over one's
bead," and its importance bas been stressed in a number of studies.
In one study, the importance of images-i.e., symbols-for house
form is stressed, and the pitched roof is said to be symbolic of
shelter while the flat roof is not, and is therefore unacceptable on
symbolic grounds. Another study of this subject shows the importance
of these aspects in the choice of house form in England, and also
shows that the pitched, tile roof is a symbol of security. It is considered,
and even shown in a building-society advertisement, as an
umbrella, and the houses directly reflect this view. Amos Rapoport,
House Form and Culture, Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall,
1969, p. .)
George Rand has drawn a similar point from his research. Rand
finds that people are extremely conservative about their images of
home and shelter. Despite  years of the flat roofs of the
"modern movement," people still /ind the simple pitched roof
the most powerful symbol of shelter. George Rand, "Children's
Images of Houses: A Prolegomena to the Study of Why People
Still Want Pitched Roofs," Environmental Design: Research and
Practice, Proceedings of the EDRA / AR  Conference, University
of California at Los Angeles, William J. Mitchell, ed., January
1972, pp. -9- to -9-10.)
And the French psychiatrist, Menie Gregoire, makes the
following observation about children:
At Nancy the children from the apartments were asked to draw a
house. These children had been born in these apartment slabs which
stand up like a house of cards upon an isolated hill. Without exception
they each drew a small cottage with two windows and smoke
curling up from a chimney on ti1c roof. M. Gregoire, "The Child
in the High-Rise," Ekistics, May  , pp.   -33.)

BUILDINGS
Such evidence as this can perhaps be dismissed on the grounds
that it is culturally induced. But there is a second kind of evidence,
more obvious, which lies in the simple fact of making
the connection between the features of a roof and the feeling of
shelter completely clear. In the passage which follows, we explain
the geometric features which a roof must have in order to create
an atmosphere of shelter.
I. The space under or on the roof must be useful space, space
that people come into contact with daily. The whole feeling of
shelter comes from the fact that the roof sunounds people at
the same time that it covers them. You can imagine this taking
either of the following forms. In both cases, the rooms under the
roof are actually surrounded by the roof.
Two roof sections.
 Seen from afar, the roof of the building must be made to
form a massive part of the building. When you see the building,
you see the roof. This is perhaps the most dramatic feature of a
strong, sheltering roof.
What constitutes the charm to the eye of the old-fashioned country
barn but its immense roof-a slope of gray shingle exposed to the
weather like the side of a hill, and by its amplitude suggesting a
bounty that warms the heart. Many of the old farmhouses, too, were
modelled on the same generous scale, and at a distance little was
visible but their great sloping roofs. They covered their inmates as
a hen covereth her brood, and are touching pictures of the domestic
spirit in its simpler forms. John Burroughs, Signs and Seasons, New
York: Houghton Miffiin, 14, p. )
 And a sheltering roof must be placed so that one can
touch it-touch it from outside. If it is pitched or vaulted, some

I  SHELTERING ROOF
part of the roof must come down low to the ground, just in a
place where there is a path, so that it becomes a natural thing to
touch the roof edge as you pass it.
Roof edges you can toucl,.
Therefore:
Slope the roof or make a vault of it, make its entire surface
visible, and bring the eaves of the roof down low, as
low as ' o" or '6" at places like the entrance, where people
pause. Build the top story of each wing right into the roof,
so that the roof does not only cover it, but actually surrounds
it.

I I  ROOF GARDEN*

in between the sloping roofs created by SHELTERING ROOF
(  ), the roofs are flat where people can walk out on them.
This pattern describes the best position for these roof gardens
and specifies their character. If they are correctly placed, they
will most often form the ends of WINGS OF LIGHT  ro7 at
different stories and will, therefore, automatically help to complete
the overall CASCADE OF ROOFS II ).

A vast part of the earth's surface, in a town, consists
of roofs. Couple this with the fact that the total area of
a town which can be exposed to the sun is finite, and you
will realize that is is natural, and indeed essential, to
make roofs which take advantage of the sun and air.
However, as we know from SHELTERING ROOF II  and
ROOF VAULTS 20), the flat shape is quite unnatural for roofs
from psychological, structural, and climatic points of view. It is
therefore sensible to use a flat roof only where the roof will
actually become a garden or an outdoor room; to make as many of
these "useful" roofs as possible; but to make all other roofs, which
cannot be used, the sloping, vaulted, shell-like structures specified
by SHELTERING ROOF r  and ROOF VAULT 20).
Here is a rule of thumb: if possible, make at least one small
roof garden in every building, more if you are sure people will
actually use them. Make the re1mining roofs steep roofs. Since,
as we shall see, the roof gardens which work are almost always
at the same level as some indoor rooms, this means that at least
some part of the building's roofs will always be steep. We shall
expect, then, that this pattern will generate a roof landscape in
which roof gardens and steep roofs are mixed in almost every
building.
We now consider the flat roof, briefly, on its own terms. Flat
roof gardens have always been prevalent in dry, warm climates,
where they can be made into livable environments. In the dense
parts of towns in Mediterranean climates, nearly every roof is
rr ROOF GARDEN
habitable: they are full of green, private screens, with lovely
views, places to cook out and eat and sleep. And even in temperate
climates they are beautiful. They can be designed as rooms without
ceilings, places that are protected from the wind, but open
to the sky.
However, the flat roofs that have become architectural fads
during the last  years are quite another matter. Gray gravel
covered asphalt structures, these flat roofs are very rarely useful
places; they are not gardens; and taken as a whole, they do not
meet the psychological requirements that we have outlined in
SHELTERING ROOF II ). To make the flat parts of roofs truly
useful, and compatible with the need for sloping roofs, it seems
necessary to build flat roof gardens off the indoor parts of the
buildings. In other words, do not make them the highest part
of the roof; let the highest parts of the roof slope; and make it
possible to walk out to the roof garden from an interior room,
without climbing special stairs. We have found that roof gardens
that have this relationship are used far more intensely than those
rooftops which must be reached by climbing stairs. The explanation
is obvious: it is far more comfortable to walk straight out
onto a roof and feel the comfort of part of the building behind
and to one side of you, then it is to climb up to a place you
cannot see.
Therefore:
Make parts of almost every roof system usable as roof
gardens. Make these parts flat, perhaps terraced for planting,
with places to sit and sleep, private places. Place the
roof gardens at various stories, and always make it possible
to walk directly out onto the roof garden from some
lived-in part of the building.
rooms at the same level


BUILDINGS

Remember to try and put the roof gardens at the open ends of
WINGS OF LIGHT 07 so as not to take the daylight away from
lower stories. Some roof gardens may be like balconys or galleries
or terraces-PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET  I 0)' GALLERY
SURROUND  6)' SIX-FOOT BALCONY  I ). In any case, place
the roof garden so that it is sheltered from the wind-SUNNY
PLACE  I  I), and give part of the roof some extra kind of shelter
-perhaps a canns awning-so that people can stay on the roof
but keep out of the hot sun-CANVAS ROOFS 4). Treat each
individual garden much the way as any other garden, with
flowers, vegetables, outdoor rooms, canvas awnings, climbing

areas have been given their rough shape it is the
right time to give more detailed attention ta the

the CASCADE OF ROOFS II  may be completed by arcades.
Paths along the building, snort patns between buildings, PEDESTRIAN
STREET  I 00), paths between CONNECTED BUILDINGS
( 08), and parts of CIRCULATION REALMS  8 are all best as
arcades. This is one of the most beautiful patterns in the language;
it affects the total character of buildings as few other patterns do.
Arcades-covered walkways at the edge of buildings,
which are partly inside, partly outside-play a vital role in
the way that people interact with buildings.
Buildings are often much more unfriendly than they need to
be. They do not create the possibility of a connection with the
public world outside. They do not genuinely invite the public in;
they operate essentially as private territory for the people who are
inside.
The problem lies in the fact that there are no strong connections
between the territorial world within the building and
the purely public world outside. There are no realms between
the two kinds of spaces which are ambiguously a part of eachplaces
that are both characteristic of the territory inside and,
simultaneously, part of the public world. ·
The classic solution to this problem is the arcade: arcades create
an ambiguous territory between the public world and the private
world, and so make buildings friendly. But they need the following
properties to be successful.
I. To make them public, the public path to the building must
itself become a place that is partly inside the building; and this
place must contain the character of the inside.
If the major paths through and beside lhe buildings are
genuinely public, covered by an extension of the building, a low
arcade, with openings into the building-many doors and
windows and half-open walls-then people are drawn into the
building; the action is on display, they feel tan gen ti ally a pa rt
of it. Perhaps they will watch, step inside, and ask a question.
BUILDINGS
 To establish this place as a territory which is also apart
from the public world, ·it must be felt as an extension of the
building interior and therefore covered.
The arcade is the most simple and beautiful way of making
such a territory. Arcades run along the building, where it meets
the public world; they are open to the public, yet set partly into
the building and at least seven feet deep.
 Arcades don't work if the edges of the ceiling arc too
high. Keep the edges of the arcade ceilings low.
The edges of !he ceiling are too high.
 In certain cases, the effect of the arcade can be increased if
the paths open to the public pass right through the building.
This is especially effective in those places where the building
wings arc narrow-then the passage through the building need
be no more than  feet long. It is very beautiful if these "tunnels"
connect arcades on both sides of the wing. The importance
of these arcades which pass right through a building; depends on
the same functional effects as those described in BUILDING
THOROUGHFARE 01).
Arcades which pass t!,roug!t buildings.
In those parts of the world where this pattern has taken hold,
there are miles of linked and half-linked Hcades and covered
w:ilks passing by and through the public p:irts of the town. This
covered space then becomes the setting for much of the informal
business of the city. Indeed, Rudofsky claims that such space
"takes the place of the ancient forum." A good deal of his book,

I I  ARCADES
Stt-eets for People, is concerned with the arcade and the ma1Telous
ambiguities of its space:
It simply never occurs to us to make streets into oases rather than
deserts. In countries where their function has not yet deteriorated
into highways and parking lots, a number of arrangements make
streets fit for humans; pergole and awnings that is, awnings
spread across a street), tentlike structures, or permanent roofs. All
are characteristic of the Orient, or countries with an oriental heritage,
like Spain. The most refined street coverings, a tangible expression of
civic solidarity-or, should one say, of philanthropy-are arcades.
Unknown and unappreciated in our latitudes, the function of this
singularly ingratiating feature goes far beyond providing shelter
against the elements or protecting pedestrians from traffic hazards.
Apart from lending unity to the streetscape, they often take the place
of the ancient forums. Throughout Europe, North Africa, and Asia,
arcades are a common sight because they also have been incorporated
into "formal" architecture. Bologna's streets, to cite but one example,
are accompanied by nearly twenty miles of portici. Bernard Rudofsky,
Streets for People, New York: Doubleday, 69, p. .)
Simple and beautiful.
Therefore:
Wherever paths run along the edge of buildings, build
arcades, and use the arcades, above all, to connect up the
buildings to one another, so that a person can walk from
place to place under the cover of the arcades .

I  PATHS AND GOALS*

... once buildings and arcades and open spaces have been
roughly fixed by BUILDING COMPLEX   ), WINGS OF LIGHT
(107), POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE 06), ARCADES 19)-it is
time to pay attention to the paths which run between the
buildings. This pattern shapes these paths and also helps to give
more detailed form to DEGREES OF PUBLICNESS ), NETWORK
OF PATHS AND CARS 2), and CIRCULATION REALMS 8).
The layout of paths will seem right and comfortable only
when it is compatible with the process of walking. And the
process of walking is far more subtle than one might
imagine.
Essentially there are three complementary processes:
I. As you walk along you scan the landscape for intermediate
destinations-the furthest points along the path which you can
see. You try, more or less, to walk in a straight line toward these
points. This naturally has the effect that you will cut corners
and take "diagonal" paths, since these are the ones which often
form straight lines between your present position and the point
which you are making for.
Path to a goal.
 These intermediate destinations keep changing. The further
you walk, the more you can see around the corner. If you always
walk straight toward this furthest point and the furthest point
keeps changing, you will actually move in a slow curve, like a
missile tracking a moving target.

I  PATHS AND GOALS
• ... -- -- -- ,,
,,, , -_.,, .
Series of goals.
fi
•
 Since you do not want to keep changing direction while you
walk and do not want to spend your whole time re-calculating
your best direction of travel, you arrange your walking process
in such a way that you pick a temporary "goal"-some clearly
visible landmark-which is more or less in the direction you want
to take and then walk in a straight line toward it for a hundred
yards, then, as you get close, pick another new goal, once more a
hundred yards further on, and walk toward it. ... You do this
so that in between, you can talk, think, daydream, smell the
spring, without having to think about your walking direction
every minute.
T J,e actual pat!t.
In the diagram above a person begins at A and heads for point
E. Along the way, his intermediate goals are points B, C, and
D. Since he is trying to walk in a roughly straight line toward
E, his intermediate goal changes from B to C, as soon as C is
visible; and from C to D, as soon as Dis visible.
The proper arrangements of paths is one with enough intermediate
goals, to make th is process workable. If there aren't
enough intermediate goals, the process of walking becomes more
difficult, and consumes unnecessary emotional energy.
Therefore:
To lay out paths, first place goals at natural points of interest.
Then connect the goals to one another to form the
BUILDINGS
paths. The paths may be straight, or gently curving between
goals; their paving should swell around the goal.
The goals should never be more than a few hundred feet
apart.
All the ordinary things in the outdoors-trees, fountains, entrances,
gateways, seats, statues, a swing, an outdoor room-can
be the goals. See FAMJLY OF ENTRANCES   oz), MAIN ENTRANCE
(110), TREE PLACES 1), SEAT SPOTS 1), RAISED FLOWERS
( ); build the "goals" according to the rules of SOMETHING
ROUGHLY IN THE MIDDLE  I ); and shape the paths according
to PATH SHAPE    I). To pave the paths use PAVING WITH CRACKS

I  I PATH SHAPE*
... paths of various kinds have been defined by larger patterns-
PROMENADE   I) SHOPPING STREET   ) NETWORK OF
PATHS AND CARS 2), RAISED WALK 5), PEDESTRIAN STREET
(mo), and PATHS AND GOALS 0). This pattern defines their
shape: and it can also help to generate these larger patterns piecemeal,
through the very process of shaping parts of the path.

Streets should be for staying in, and not just for moving
through, the way they are today.
For centuries, the street provided city dwellers with usable
public space right outside their houses. Now, in a number of
subtle ways, the modern city has made streets which are for "going
through," not for "staying in." This is reinforced by regulations
which make it a crime to loiter, by the greater attractions inside
the side itself, and by streets which are so unattractive to
stay in, that they almost force people into their houses.
From an environmental standpoint, the essence of the problem
is this: streets are "centrifugal" not "centripetal": they drive
people out instead of attracting them in. In order to combat this
effect, the pedestrian world outside houses must be made into the
kind of place where you stay, rather than the kind of place you
move through. It must, in short, be made like a kind of outside
public room, with a greater sense of enclosure than a street.
This can be accomplished if we make residential pedestrian
streets subtly convex in plan with seats and galleries around the
edges, and even sometimes roof the streets with beams or trelliswork.
Here are two examples of this pattern, at two different scales.
First, we show a plan of ours for fourteen houses in Peru. The
street shape is created by gradually stepping back the houses, in
plan. The result is a street with a positive, somewhat elliptical
shape. We hope it is a place that will encourage people to
slow down and spend time there.

The second example is a very small path, cutting through a
neighborhood in the hills of Berkeley. Again, the shape swells out
subtly, just in those places where it is good to pause and sit.

Therefore:
Make a bulge in the middle of a public path, and make

which is a place to stay, not just a place to pass through.

length with windows-STREET WINDOWS( 4 ....

 BUILDING FRONTS*
... this pattern helps to shape the paths and buildings simultaneously;
and so completes BUILDING COMPLEX 5), WINGS OF
LIGHT 07), POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE 06), ARCADES 19),
PATH SHAPE  l 1)' and also ACTIVITY POCKETS  I ).
Building set-backs from the street, originally invented to
protect the public welfare by giving every building light
and air, have actually helped greatly to destroy the street
as a social space.
In POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE  06 we have described the fact
that buildings are not merely placed into the outdoors, but that
they actually shape the outdoors. Since streets and squares have
such enormous social importance, it is natural to pay close attention
to the way that they are shaped by building fronts.
The early twentieth-century urge for "cleanliness" at all costs,
and the social efforts to clean up slums, led social reformers to
pass laws which make it necessary to place buildings several feet
back from the street edge, to make sure that buildings cannot
crowd the street and cut off sunshine, light, and air.
But, the set backs have destroyed the streets. Since it is possible
to guarantee plenty of air and sun in buildings and streets in other
ways-see, for example., FOUR-STORY LIMIT   I and WINGS OF
LIGHT  07)-it is e'ssential to build the front of buildings on the
street, so that the streets which they create are usable.
Finally, note that the positive shape of the street cannot be
achieved by merely staggering building fronts. If the building
fronts are adjusted to the shape of the outdoors, they will almost
always take on a variety of slightly uneven angles.

BUILDINGS
Slight angles in the building fronts.
Therefore:
On no account allow set-backs between streets or paths or

The set-backs do nothing valuable and almost always destroy
the value of the open areas between the buildings.
Build right up to the paths; change the laws in all communities
where obsolete by-laws make this impossible. And let
the building fronts take on slightly uneven angles as they
accommodate to the shape of the street.

I   PEDESTRIAN DENSITY*
in vanous places there are pedestrian areas, paved so that
people will congregate there or walk up and down-PROMENADE
(  I), SMALL PUBLIC SQUARES   I), PEDESTRIAN STREET  00),
BUILDING THOROUGHFARE 01), PATH SHAPE 1). It is essential
to limit the sizes of these places very strictly, especially
the size of areas which are paved, so that they stay alive.

Many of our modern public squares, though intended as
lively plazas, are in fact deserted and dead.
In this pattern, we call attention to the relationship between
the number of people in a pedestrian area, the size of the area,
and a subjective estimate of the extent to which the area is alive.
We do not say categorically that the number of people per
square foot controls the apparent liveliness of a pedestrian area.
Other factors-the nature of the land around the edge, the
grouping of people, what the people are doing-obviously contribute
greatly. People who are running, especially if they are
making noise, add to the liveliness. A small group attracted to a
couple of folk singers in a plaza give much more life to the
place than the same number sunning on the grass.
However, the number of square feet per person does give a
reasonably crude estimate of the liveliness of a space. Christie
Coffin's observations show the following figures for various public
places in and around San Francisco. Her estimate of the liveliness
of the places is given in the right-hand column.

Although these subjective estimates are clearly open to question,
they suggest the following rule of thumb: At I  square feet
per person, an area is lively. If there are more than  square feet
per person, the area begins to be dead.

BUILDINGS
Even if these figures are only correct to within an order of
magnitude, we can use them to shape public pedestrian areassquares,
indoor streets, shopping streets, promenades.
To use the pattern it is essential to make a rough estimate of
the number of people that are typically found in a given space
at any moment of its use. In the front area of a market, for example,
we might /ind that typically there are three people lingering
and walking. Then we shall want the front of this market to
form a little square, no larger than  square feet. If we estimate
a pedestrian street will typically contain   people window
shopping and walking, we shall want the street to form an enclosure
of roughly  square feet. For an example of this calculation
in a more complicated case-the case of a square in a public
building that has yet to be built-see   Which
Generates Multi-Se1·vice Centers, Alexander, Ishikawa, Silverstein,
Center for Environmental Structure, 68, p. r .)
Therefore:
For public squares, courts, pedestrian streets, any place
where crowds are drawn together, estimate the mean number
of people in the place at any given moment P), and

I  ACTIVITY POCKETS**

... in many large scale patterns which define public space, the
edge is critical: PROMENADE 1), SMALL PUBLIC SQUARES 1),
PUBLIC OUTDOOR ROOM ), PEDESTRIAN STREET roo), BUILDING
THOROUGHFARE IOI), PATH SHAPE  I 1). This pattern
helps complete the edge of all these larger patterns.
The life of a public square forms naturally around its
edge. If the edge fails, then the space never becomes lively.
In more detail: people gravitate naturally toward the edge of
public spaces. They do not linger out in the open. If the edge
does not provide them with places where it is natural to linger,
the space becomes a place to walk through, not a place to
stop. It is therefore clear that a public square should be surrounded
by pockets of activity: shops, stands, benches, displays, rails, courts,
gardens, news racks. In effect, the edge must be scalloped.
Further, the process of lingering is a gradual one; it happens;
people do not make up their minds to stay; they stay or go, according
to a process of gradual involvement. This means that the
various pockets of activity around the edge should all be next to
paths and entrances so that people pass right by them as they pass
through. The goal-oriented activity of coming and going then has
a chance to turn gradually into something more relaxed. And
once many small groups form around the edge, it is likely that
they will begin to overlap and spill in toward the center of the
square. We therefore specify that pockets of activity must alternate
with access points.
II conceptual diagram.

I  ACTIVITY POCKETS
The scalloped edge must surround the space entirely. We may
see this clearly as follows: draw a circle to represent the space, and
darken some part of its perimeter to stand for the scalloped edge.
Now draw chords which join different points along this
darkened perimeter. As the length of the darkened edge gets
smaller, the area of the space covered by these chords wanes drastically.
This shows how quickly the life in the space will drop
when the length of the scalloped edge gets shorter. To make the
space lively, the scalloped edge must surround the space completely.

As tl,e activities grow around the space,
it becomes more lively.
When we say that the edge must be scalloped with activity, we
mean this conceptually-not literally. In fact, to build ·this pattern,
you must build the activity pockets forward into the
square: first rough out the major paths that cross the space and the
spaces left over between these paths; then build the activity pockets
into these "in-between" spaces, bringing them forward, into
the square.

FAMILY OF ENTRANCES !02), MAIN ENTRANCES ), and
OPEN STAIRS ),

Wherever there is action in a place, the spots which are
the most inviting, are those high enough to give people a
vantage point, and low enough to put them in action.
On the one hand, people seek a vantage point from which they
can take in the action as a whole. On the other hand, they still
want to be part of the action; they do not want to be mere
onlookers. Unless a public space provides for both these tendencies,
a lot of people simply will not stay there.
For a person looking at the horizon, the visual field is far
larger below the horizon than above it. It is therefore clear that
anybody who is "people-watching" will naturally try to take up
a position a few feet above the action.
The trouble is that this position will usually have the effect of
removing a person from the action. Yet most people want to be
able to take the action in and to be part of it at the same time.
This means that any places which are slightly elevated must also
be within easy reach of passers-by, hence on circulation paths, and
directly accessible from below.
The bottom few steps of stairs, and the balusters and rails
along stairs, are precisely the kinds of places which resolve these
tendencies. People sit on the edges of the lower steps, if they are
wide enough and inviting, and they lean against the rails.
There is a simple kind of evidence, both for the reality of the
forces described here and for the value of the pattern. When
there are areas in public places which are both slightly raised
and very accessible, people naturally gravitate toward them.
I  STAIR SEATS
Stepped cafe terraces, steps surrounding public plazas, stepped
porches, stepped statues and seats, are all examples.
Therefore:
In any public place where people loiter, add a few steps
at the edge where stairs come down or where there is a
change of level. Make these raised areas immediately accessible
from below, so that people may congregate and sit
to watch the goings-on.

A public space without a middle s quite likely to stay
empty.
We have discussed the fact that people tend to take up positions
from which they are protected, partly, at their backs-HIERARCHY
or- OPEN SPACE  14), and the way this fact tends to make the
action grow around the edge of public sguares-ACTIVITY POCKEH

need for anything beyond an edge. But if there is a reasonable
area in the middle, intended for public use, it will be wasted
unless there are trees, monuments, scats, fountains-., place
where people can protect their backs, as easilr as they crn around
the edge. This reason for setting something roughly in the middle
of a sguarc is obvious and pr:ictical. But perhaps there is an ffCn
more primitive instinct ;it work.

it has nothing to do with actil"ities at the edge or in the center.
Apparently the effect is purely geometrical. Perhaps it is the
sheer fact that the space of the table is given a center, and the
point at the center then organizes the space around it, and makes
it clear, and puts it roughly at rest. The same thing happens in :i
courtyard or a public square. It is perhaps related to the man-

I SOMETHING ROUGHLY IN THE MIDDLE
dala instinct, which finds in any centrally symmetric figure a
powerful receptacle for dreams and images and for conjugations
of the self.
We believe that this instinct is at work in every courtyard and
every square. Even in the Piazza San Marco, one of the few
squares without an obvious center piece, the campanile juts out
and creates an off beat center to the two plazas together.
The campanile forms a rough center to t!te t'LVOp iazzas.
Camillo Sitte, the great Italian planner, describes the evolution
of such focal points and their functional significance in his book
City Planning According to Artistic Principles New York: Random
House, 65, pp. 0-31). But interestingly, he claims that
the impulse to center something perfectly in a square is an "affliction"
of modern times.
Imagine the open square of a small market town in the country,
covered with deep snow and criss-crossed by several roads and
paths that, shaped by the traffic, form the natural lines of communication.
Between them are left irregularly distributed patches untouched
by traffic. . . .
On exactly such spots, undisturbed by the flow of vehicles, rose the
fountains and monuments of old communities.
Therefore:
Between the natural paths which cross a public square
or courtyard or a piece of common land choose something
to stand roughly in the middle: a fountain, a tree, a statue,
a clock-tower with seats, a windmill, a bandstand. Make

Now, with the paths fixed, we come back to the

space, and decide how the movemr.nt will connect

... if you know roughly where you intend to place the building
wings-WINGS OF LIGHT  r 07), and how many stories they will
have-NUMBER OF STORIES  6), and where the MAIN ENTRANCE
(  ro is, it is time to work out the rough disposition of the
major areas on every floor. In every building the relationship
between the public areas and private areas is most important.

Unless the spaces in a building are arranged in a sequence
which corresponds to their degrees of privateness,
the visits made by strangers, friends, guests, clients, family,
will always be a little awkward.
In any building-house, office, public building, summer cottage-
people need a gradient of settings, which have different
degrees of intimacy. A bedroom or boudoir is most intimate; a
back sitting room or study less so; a common area or kitchen more
public still; a front porch or entrance room most public of all.
When there is a gradient of this kind, people can give each encounter
different shades of meaning, by choosing its position
on the gradient very carefully. In a building which has its
rooms so interlaced that there is no clearly defined gradient
of intimacy, it is not possible to choose the spot for any particular
encounter so carefully; and it is therefore impossible to give the
encounter this dimension of added meaning by the choice of
space. This homogeneity of space, where every room has a similar
degree of intimacy, rubs out all possible subtlety of social interaction
in the building.
We illustrate th is general fact by giving an exam pie from
Peru-a case which we have studied in detail. In Peru, friendship
is taken very seriously and exists at a number of levels. Casual
neighborhood friends will probably never enter the house at all.

I  INTIMACY GRADIENT
Formal friends, such as the priest, the daughter's boyfriend, and
friends from work may be invited in, but tend to be limited to a
well-furnished and maintained part of the house, the sala. This
room is sheltered from the clutter and more obvious informality of
the rest of the house. Relatives and intimate friends may be made
to feel at home in the family room comedor-estar), where the
family is likely to spend much of its time. A few relatives and
friends, particularly women, will be allowed into the kitchen,
other workspaces, and, perhaps, the bedrooms of the house. In
this way, the family maintains both privacy and pride.
The phenomenon of the intimacy gradient is particularly
evident at the time of a fiesta. Even though the house is full of
people, some people never get beyond the sala; some do not even
get beyond the th res hold of the front door. Others go all the
way into the kitchen, where the cooking is going on, and stay
there throughout the evening. Each person has a very accurate
sense of his degree of intimacy with the family and knows
exactly how far into the house he may penetrate, according to
this established level of intimacy.
Even extremely poor people try to have a sala if they can: we
saw many in the barriadas. Yet modern houses and apartments in
Peru combine sala and family room in order to save space, Almost
everyone we talked to complained about this situation. As
far as we can tell, a Peruvian house must not, under any circumstances,
violate the principle of the intimacy gradient.
The intimacy gradient is unusually crucial in a Peruvian house.
But in some form the pattern seems to exist in almost all cultures.
We see it in widely different cultures-compare the plan of an
African compound, a traditional Japanese house, and early American
colonial homes-and it also applies to almost every building
type-compare a house, a small shop, a large office building, and
even a church. It is almost an archetypal ordering principle for
all man's buildings. All buildings, and all parts of buildings
which house well-denned human groups, need a delinite gradient
from "front" to "back," from the most formal spaces at the
front to the most intimate spaces at the back.
In an office the sequence might be: entry lobby, coffee and
reception areas, offices and workspaces, private lounge.

In a small shop the sequence might be: shop entrance, customer

In a house: gate, outdoor porch, entrance, sitting wall, common

And in a more formal house, the sequence might begin with
something like the Peruvian sala-a parlor or sitting room for
guests.

Therefore:
Lay out the spaces of a building so that they create a sequence
which begins with the entrance and the most public
parts of the building, then leads into the slightly more
private areas, and finally to the most private domains. _-----)-- -- ·- --· - =..=..!.=.,. _- ---+--

At the same time that common areas are to the front, make

that all paths between more private rooms pass tangent to the

I  INDOOR SUNLIGHT*

... according to SOUTH FACING OUTDOORS  I 05), the building
is placed in such a way as to allow the sun to shine directly into
it, across its gardens. From INTIMACY GRADIENT ), you
have some idea of the overall distribution of public and private
rooms within the building. This pattern marks those rooms and
areas along the intimacy gradient which need the sunlight most,
and helps to place them so that the indoor sunlight can be made
to coincide with the rooms in the INTIMACY GRADIENT which are
most used.

If the right rooms are facing south, a house is bright and
sunny and cheerful; if the wrong rooms are facing south,
the house is dark and gloomy.
Everyone knows this. But people may forget about it, and
get confused by other considerations. The fact is that very few
things have so much effect on the feeling inside a room as the
sun shining into it. If you want to be sure that your house, or
building, and the rooms in it are wonderful, comfortable places,
give this pattern its due. Treat it seriously; cling to it tenaciously;
insist upon it. Think of the rooms you know which do have
sunshine in them, and compare them with the many rooms you
know that don't.
From the pattern SOUTH FACING OUTDOORS  05), the building
gets an orientation toward the south. Now the issue is the
particular arrangement of rooms along this south edge. Here are
some examples:   a porch that gets the evening sun late in the
day;   a breakfast nook that looks directly into a garden
which is sunny in the morning;  a bathing room arranged to
get full morning sun;  a workshop that gets full southern exposure
during the middle of the day;   an edge of a living
room where the sun fal1s on an outside wall and warms a flowering
plant.
The key diagram for this pattern summarizes the relations
between parts of the house and the morning, the afternoon and
BUILDINGS
the late afternoon sun. To get the sun right in your design, first
decide upon your requirements for sun: make a diagram for
yourself, like the key diagram, but with your own special needs.
Then arrange spaces along the south, southeast, and southwest of
the building to capture the sun. Take special care to detail
the south edge properly, so that the sun is working indoors
throughout the day. This will most often need a building which
is long along the east-west axis.
If we approach the problem of indoor sunlight from the point
of view of thermal considerations, we come to a similar conclusion.
A long east-west axis sets up a building to keep the heat
in during winter, and to keep the heat out during the summer.
This makes buildings more pleasant, and cheaper to run. The
"optimum shape" of an east-west building is given by the following
table, adapted from Victor Olgyay, Design with Climate
(New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 63, p. ). Note
that it is always best to orient the long axis east-west.

Therefore:
Place the most important rooms along the south edge of
the building, and spread the building out along the eastwest
axis.
Fine tune the arrangement so that the proper rooms are
exposed to the south-east and the south-west sun. For example:
give the common area a full southern exposure,
bedrooms south-east, porch south-west. For most climates,
this means the shape of the building is elongated east-west.

I  COMMON AREAS
AT THE HEART**
. . . along the INTIMACY GRADIENT  I  ), in every building
and in every social group within the building, it is necessary to
place the common areas. Place them on the sunlit side to reinforce
the pattern of JNDOOR sUNLJGHT  I  ; and, when they
are large, give them the higher roofs of the CASCADE OF ROOFS
(I ).
No social group-whether a family, a work group, or a
school group-can survive without constant informal contact
among its members.
Any building which houses a social group supports this kind of
contact by providing common areas. The form and location of
the common areas is critical. Here is a perfect example-a description
of the family room in a Peruvian worker's house:
For a ]ow-income Peruvian family, the family room is the
heart of family life. The family eat here, they watch TV here,
and everyone who comes into the house comes into this room to
say hello to the others, kiss them, shake hands with them, exchange
news. The same happens when people leave the house.
The family room functions as the heart of the family life by
helping to support these processes. The room is so placed in
the house, that people naturally pass through it on their way into
and out of the house. The end where they pass through it allows
them to linger for a few moments, without having to pull out a
chair to sit down. The TV set is at the opposite end of the
room from this throughway, and a glance at the screen is often
the excuse for a moment's further lingering. The part of the
room for the TV set is often darkened; the family room and the
TV function just as much during midday as they do at night.
Let us now generalize from this example. If a common area is

I  COM MON AREAS AT THE HEART
located at the end of a corridor and people have to make a
special, deliberate effort to go there, they are not likely to use it
informally and spontaneously.

... At one end.
Alternati1·ely, if the circulation path cuts too deeply through
the common area, the space will be too exposed, it will not be
comfortable to linger there and settle down .
. . . T hroug!t the middle.
The only balanced situation is the one where a common path,
which people use every day, runs tangent to the common areas
and is open to them in passing. Then people will be constantly
passing the space; but because the path is to one side, they are
not forced to stop. If they want to, they can keep going. If they
want to, they can stop for a moment, and see what's happening;
if they want to, they can come right in and settle down .
. . . Tangent.
It is worth mentioning, that this pattern has occurred, in some
form, in every single project we have worked on. In the multiservice
center, we had a pattern called Staff lounge based on the
same geometry   which generates multi-service
centers, C.E.S., 68, p. 1); in our work on mental health
centers, we had Patient's choice of being involved, the same pattern
again, as an essential element in therapy; in our work on
Peruvian housing, we had Family room cirwlation-this is the
example we ha1·e given for a family Hou.res generaterl by patte.ms,
C.E.S., 69, p. 0); and in our work on universities, The
BUILDINGS
Oregon Experiment, we had a pattern called Department hearth,
again the same, for each department. It is perhaps the most basic
pattern there is in forming group cohesion.
In detail, we have isolated three characteristics for a successful
common area:
I. It must be at the center of gravity of the building complex,
building, or building wing which the group occupies. In other
words, it must be at the physical heart of the organization, so that
it is equally accessible to everyone and can be felt as the center
of the group.
 Most important of all, it must be "on the way" from the
entrance to private rooms, so people always go by it on the way in
and out of the building. It is crucial that it not be a dead-end
room which one would have to go out of one's way to get to.
For this reason, the paths which pass it must lie tangent to it .

The common area of a clinic we /,ave built in Modes to,
California, w!tere we managed to put tangent paths on all
four sides.
 It must have the right components in it-usually a kitchen
and eating space, since eating is one of the most communal of
activities, and a sitting space-at least some comfortable chairs,
so people will feel like staying. It should also include an outdoor
area-on nice days there is always the longing to be outsideto
step out for a smoke, to sit down on the grass, to carry on a
discussion.

I COMMON AREAS AT THE HEART
Therefore:
Create a single common area for every social group. Locate
it at the center of gravity of all the spaces the group
occupies, and in such a way that the paths which go in and
out of the building lie tangent to it.

... the pos1t10n and overall shape of entrances is given by
FAMILY OF ENTRANCES 02), MAIN ENTRANCE  and
ENTRANCE TRANSITION  12). This pattern gives the entrances
their detailed shape, their shape and body and three dimensions,
and helps complete the form begun by CAR CONNECTION   I ),
and the PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET 0).
Arriving in a building, or leaving it, you need a room
to pass through, both inside the building and outside it.
This is the entrance room.
The most impressionistic and intuitive way to describe the
need for the entrance room is to say that the time of arriving,
or leaving, seems to swell with respect to the minutes which
precede and follow it, and that in order to be congruent with
the importance of the moment, the space too must follow suit
and swell with respect to the immediate inside and the immediate
outside of the building.
We shall see now that there are a tremendous number of
miniscule forces which all come together to support this general
intuition. All these forces, tendencies, and solutions were originally
describe by Alexander and Poyner, in the Atoms of Environmental
Structure, Ministry of Public Works, Research and
Development, SFB Ba4, London, 66. At that time it seemed
important to emphasize the separate and individual patterns defined
by these forces. However, at the present writing it seems
clear that these original patterns are, in fact, all faces of the one
larger and more comprehensive entity, which we call the ENTRANCE
ROOM  I 0).

The entrance room therefore needs a window-or windowson

 The need for shelter outside the door
(a People try to get shelter from the rain, wind, and cold

On the outside, therefore, give the entrance room walls enclosing
three sides of a covered space.
 The subtleties of saying goodbye
When hosts and guests are saying goodbye, the lack of a clearly
marked "goodbye" point can easily lead to endless "Well, we
really must be going now,." and then further conversations lingering
on, over and over again.
(a Once they have finally decided to go, people try to leave
without hesitation.
(b People try to make their goodbye as nonabrupt as possible
and seek a comfortable break.
Give the entrance room, therefore, a clearly defined area, at
least  square feet, outside the front door, raised with a natural
threshold-perhaps a railing, or a low wall, or a step-between
it and the visitors' cars.

You can avoid these conflicts if there are shelves both inside
and outside the door, at about waist height; a place to leave
packages in readiness; a place to put them down while opening
the door.
 Interior of the entrance room
(a Politeness demands that when someone comes to the door,
the door is opened wide.
(b People seek privacy for the inside of their houses.
(c The family, sitting, talking, or at table, do not want to
feel disturbed or intruded upon when someone comes to the
door.
Make the inside of the entrance room zigzag, or obstructed,
so that a person standing on the doorstep of the open door can
see no rooms inside, except the entrance room itself, nor
through the doors of any rooms.

balls-around the door they use most often.
Therefore, give the entrance room a dead corner for storage,
put coat pegs in a position which can be seen from the front door,
and make an area five feet in diameter next to the pegs.
Therefore:
At the main entrance to a building, make a light-filled
room which marks the entrance and straddles the boundary
between indoors and outdoors, covering some space outdoors
and some space indoors. The outside part may be like
an old-fashioned porch; the inside like a hall or sitting room.

... next to the gradient of spaces created by INTIMACY GRADIENT
( I   and COMMON AREAS AT THE HEART  I )' the way
that rooms connect to one another will play the largest role in
governing the character of indoor space. This pattern describes
the most fundamental way of linking rooms to one another.
The movement between rooms is as important as the
rooms themselves; and its arrangement has as much effect
on social interaction in the rooms, as the interiors of the
rooms.
The movement between rooms, the circulation space, may be
generous or mean. In a building where the movement is mean,
the passages are dark and narrow-rooms open off them as dead
ends; you spend your time entering the building, or moving
between rooms, like a crab scuttling in the dark.
Compare this with a building where the movement is generous.
The passages are broad, sunlit, with seats in them, views into
gardens, and they are more or less continuous with the rooms
themselves, so that the smell of woodsmoke and cigars, the sound
of glasses, whispers, laughter, all that which enlivens a room,
also enlivens the places where you move.
These two approaches to movement have entirely different
psychological effects.
In a complex social fabric, human relations are inevitably
subtle. It is essential that each person feels free to make connections
or not, to move or not, to talk or not, to change the
situation or not, according to his judgment. If the physical environment
inhibits him and reduces his freedom of action, it will
prevent him from doing the best he can to keep healing and improving
the social situations he is in as he sees lit.
The building with generous circulation allows each person's
instincts and intuitions full play. The building with ungenerous
circulation inhibits them. It not only separates rooms from one
another to such an extent that it is an ordeal to move from room

I  I THE FLOW THROUGH ROOMS
•
to room, but kills the joy of time spent between rooms and may
discourage movement altogether.
The following incident shows how important freedom of movement
is to the life of a building. An industrial company in Lausanne
had the following experience. They installed TV-phone intercoms
between all offices to improve communication. A few
months later, the firm was going down the drain-and they called
in a management consultant. He finally traced their problems
back to the TV-phones. People were calling each other on the
TV-phone to ask specific questions-but as a result, people never
talked in the halls and passages any more-no more "Hey, how
are you, say, by the way, what do you think of this idea ... "
The organization was falling apart, because the informal talkthe
glue which held the organization together-had been
destroyed. The consultant advised them to junk the TV-phones
-and they lived happily ever after.
This incident happened in a large organization. But the principle
is just the same in a small work group or a family. The
possibility of small momentary conversations, gestures, kindnesses,
explanations which clear up misunderstandings, jokes and stories
is the lifeblood of a human group. If it get, prevented, the group
will fall apart as people's individual relationships go gradually
downhill.
 t is almost certain that the building with ungenerous circulation
makes it harder for people to maintain their social fabric.
In the long run, there is a good chance that social order in the
building with ungenerous circulation will break down altogether.
The generosity of movement depends on the overall arrangement
of the movement in the building, not on the detailed design
of individual passages. In fact, it is at its most generous, when
there are no passages at all and movement is created by a string of
interconnecting rooms with doors between them.

Even better, is the case where there s a loop. A loop, which
passes through all the major rooms, public and common, establishes
an enormous feeling of generosity. With a loop it is always
possible to come and go in two different directions. It is possible
to walk around and around, and it ties the rooms together.
And, when such a loop passes through rooms at one end so as
not to disturb them), it connects rooms far more than a simple

A building where there is a chain of rooms in sequence also
works like this, if there is a passage in parallel with the chain of

Passage in parallel forms the loop.
Therefore:
As far as possible, avoid the use of corridors and passages.
Instead, use public rooms and common rooms as
rooms for movement and for gathering. To do this, place
the common rooms to form a chain, or loop, so that it becomes
possible to walk from room to room-and so that
private rooms open directly off these public rooms. In every

" ... long, sterile corridors set the scene for everything
bad about modern architecture."
In fact, the ugly long repet1t1ve corridors of the machine age
have so far infected the word "corridor" that it is hard to
imagine that a corridor could ever be a place of beauty, a
moment in your passage from room to room, which means as
much as all the moments you spend in the rooms themselves.
Long corridors.
We shall now t:-y to pinpoint the difference Lc:tween the
corridors which live, which give pleasure, and make people feel

BUILDINGS
alive, and those which do not. There are four main issues.
The most profound issue, to our minds, is natural light. A hall
or passage that is generously  it by the sun is almost always
pleasant. The archetype is the one-sided hall, lined with windows
and doors on its open side. Notice that this is one of the few
places where it is a good idea to light a space from one side).
The second issue is the relation of the passage to the rooms
which open off it. Interior windows, opening from these rooms
into the hall, help animate the hall. They establish a /low between
the rooms and the passage; they support a more informal style
of communication; they give the person moving through the hall
a taste of life inside the rooms. Even in an office, this contact is
fine so long as it is not extreme; so long as the workplaces are
protected individually by distance or by a partial wall-see
HALF-PRIVATE OFFICE 2), WORKSPACE ENCLOSURE 3).
The third issue which makes the difference between a lively
passage and a dead one is the presence of furnishings. If the
passage is made in a way which invites people to furnish it with
book cases, small tables, places to lean, even seats, then it becomes
very much a part of the living space of the building, not something
entirely separate.
And finally, there is the critical issue of length. We know
intuitively that corridors in office buildings, hospitals, hotelr,
apartment buildings-even sometimes in houses-are far too
long. People dislike them: they represent bureaucracy and
monotony. And there is even evidence to show that they do
actual damage.
Consider a study by Mayer Spivack on the unconscious effects
of long hospital corridors on perception, communication, and behavior:
Four examples of long mental hospital corridors are examined
it is concluded that such spaces interfere with normal verbal
communication due to their characteristic acoustical properties. Optical
phenomena common to these passageways obscure the perception
of the human figure and face, and distort distance perception. Paradoxical
visual cues produced by one tunnel created interrelated,
cross-sensory illusions involving room size, distance, walking speed
and time. Observations of patient behavior suggest the effect of
narrow conidors upon anxiety is via the penetration of the personal

space envelope. M. Spivack, "Sensory Distortion in Tunnels and
Corridors," Hospital and Community Psycf1iatry, , No. , January
1967.)
When docs a corridor become too long' In an earlier version of
this pattern Short corridors in A P{)ttern L{)nguage Which
Generates Multi-Service Centers, CES, 67, pp. -82), we
have presented evidence which s,1ggests that there is a definite
cognitive breakpoint between long corridors and short halls: the
evidence points to a figure of some  feet as a critical threshold.
Beyond that, passages begin to feel dead and monotonous.
Of course it is possible to make even very long corridors in a
human way; but if they have to be longer than  feet, it is
essential to break down their scale in some fashion. For example,
a long hall that is lit in patches from one side at short intervals
can be ,·ery pleasant indeed: the sequence of light and dark and
the chance to pause and glance out, breaks down the feeling of
the endless dead corridor; or a hall which opens out into wider
rooms, every now and then, has the same effect. However, do
everything you can to keep the passages really short.
Therefore:
Keep passages short. Make them as much like rooms as
possible, with carpets or wood on the floor, furniture, bookshelves,
beautiful windows. Make them generous in shape,
and always give them plenty of light; the best corridors
and passages of all are those which have windows along
an entire wall.

I   STAIRCASE AS A STAGE

... if the entrances are in pos1t1on-MAIN ENTRANCE  II o ;
and the pattern of movement through the building is established
-THE FLOW THROUGH ROOMS 1), SHORT PASSAGES 2),
the main stairs must be put in and given -an appropriate social
character.
+ ❖ ❖
A staircase is not just a way of getting from one floor to
another. The stair is itself a space, a volume, a part of the
building; and unless this space is made to live, it will be
a dead spot, and work to disconnect the building and to
tear its processes apart.
Our feelings for the general shape of the stair are based on
this conjecture: changes of level play a crucial role at many moments
during social gatherings; they provide special places to sit, a
place where someone can make a grace£ □ ! or dramatic entrance, a
place from which to speak, a place from which to look at other
people while also being seen, a place which increases face to face
contact when many people are together.
If this is so, then the stair is one of the few places in a building
which is capable of providing for this requirement, since it
is almost the only place in a building where a transition between
levels occurs naturally.
This suggests that the stair always be made rather open to the
room below it, embracing the room, coming down around the
outer perimeter of the room, so that the stairs together with the
room form a socially connected space. Stairs that are enclosed in
stairwells ,or stairs that are free standing and chop up the space

below, do not have this character at all. But straight stairs, stairs
that follow the contour of the walls below, or stairs that double
back can all be made to work this way.
Furthermore, the first four or five steps are the places where
people are most likely to sit if the stair is working well. To
support this fact, make the bottom of the staircase flare out,
widen the steps, and make them comfortable to sit on.

Stair seats.
Finally, we must decide where to place the stair. On the
one hand, of course, the stair is the key to movement in a building.
It must therefore be visible from the front door; and, in a
building with many different rooms upstairs, it must be in a position
which commands as many of these rooms as possible, so that it
forms a kind of axis people can keep clearly in their minds.
However, if the stair is too near the door, it will be so public
that its position will undermine the vital social character we
have described. Instead, we suggest that the stair be clear, and
central, yes-but in the common area of the building, a little
further back from the front door than usual. Not usually in the

necessary social character.

so that the people coming down the stair become part of
the action in the room while they are on the stair, and so
that people below will naturally use the stair for seats.

The archetypal zen view occurs in a famous Japanese
house, which gives this pattern its name.
A Buddhist monk lived high in the mountains, in a small
stone house. Far, far in the distance was the ocean, visible and
beautiful from the mountains. But it was not visible from the
monk's house itself, nor from the approach road to the house.
However, in front of the house there stood a courtyard surrounded
by a thick stone wall. As one came to the house, one passed
through a gate into this court, and then diagonally across the court
to the front door of the house. On the far side of the courtyard
there was a slit in the wall, narrow and diagonal, cut through the
thickness of the wall. As a person walked across the court, at one
spot, where his position lined up with the slit in the wall, for an
instant, he could see the ocean. And then he was past it once
again, and went into the house.
The monk's house.
What is it that happens in this courtyard? The view of the
distant sea is so restrained that it stays alive forever. Who, that
I  ZEN VIEW
has ever seen that view, can ever forget it? Its power will never
fade. Even for the man who lives there, coming past that view
day after day for fifty years, it will still be alive.
This is the essence of the problem with any view. t is a beautiful
thing. One wants to enjoy it and drink it in every day. But
the more open it is, the more obvious, the more it shouts, the
sooner it will fade. Gradually it will become part of the building,
like the wallpaper; and the intensity of its beauty will no
longer be accessible to the people who live there.
Therefore:
If there is a beautiful view, don't spoil it by building
huge windows that gape incessantly at it. Instead, put the
windows which look onto the view at places of transitionalong
paths, in hallways, in entry ways, on stairs, between
rooms.
If the view window is correctly placed, people will see
a glimpse of the distant view as they come up to the window
or pass it: but the view is never visible from the
places where people stay.

... passages, entrances, stairs are given their rough position by
THE FLOW THROUGH ROOMS( I  I), SHORT PASSAGE(S I  ), STAIRCASE
AS A STAGE 3), ZEN vrEw ). This pattern helps you
fine tune their positions by placing light correctly.
In a building with uniform light level, there are few
"places" which function as effective settings for human
events. This happens because, to a large extent, the places
which make effective settings are defined by light.
People are by nature phototropic-they move toward light,
and, when stationary, they orient themselves toward the light. As
a result the much loved and much used places in buildings, where
the most things happen, are places like window seats, verandas,
fireside corners, trellised arbors; all of them defined by nonuniformities
in light, and all of them allowing tne people who are
in them to orient themselves toward the light.
We may say that these places become the settings for the
human events that occur in the building. Since there is good
reason to believe that people need a rich variety of settings in
their lives see for instance, Roger Barker, The Stream of
Behavior: Explorations of its Structure and Content, New York:
Appleton-Century-Crofts, I 63), and since settings are defined by
"places," which in turn seem often to be defined by light, and
since light places can only be defined by contrast with darker
ones, this suggests that the interior parts of buildings where
people spend much time should contain a great deal of alternating
light and dark. The building needs to be a tapestry of light and
dark.
This tapestry of light and dark must then fit together with the
flow of movement, too. As we have said, people naturally tend
to walk toward the light. It is therefore obvious that any entrance,
or any key point in a circulation system, must be systematically
lighter than its surroundings-with light daylight and
artificial light flooded there, so that its intensity becomes a
BUILDINGS
natural target. The reason is simple. If there are places which
have more light than the entrances and circulation nodes, people
will tend to walk toward them because of their phototropic
tendency and will therefore end up in the wrong place-with
frustration and confusion as the only possibl  result.
If the places where the Light falls are not the places you are
meant lo go toward, or if the light is uniform, the environment is
giving information which contradicts its own meaning. The environment
is only functioning in a single-hearted manner, as
information, when the lightest spots coincide with the points of
maximum importance.
Therefore:
Create alternating areas of light and dark throughout the
building, in such a way that people naturally walk toward
the light, whenever they are going to important places:
seats, entrances, stairs, passages, places of special beauty, and
make other areas darker, to increase the contrast.

(127), and can be used to help generate that gradient, if it
doesn't exist already.
The presence of children in a family often destroys the
closeness and the special privacy which a man and wife
need together.
Every couple start out sharing each other's adult lives. When
children come, concern for parenthood often overwhelms the
private sharing, and everything becomes exclusively oriented
toward the children.
In most houses this is aggravated by the physical design of the
environment. Specifically:
I. Children are able to run everywhere in the house, and
therefore tend to dominate all of it. No rooms are private.
 The bathroom is often placed so that adtilts must walk past
children's bedrooms to reach it.
 The walls of the master bedroom are usually too th in to
afford much acoustical privacy.
The result is that the private life of the couple is continually
interrupted by the awareness that the children are nearby.
Their role as parents rather than as a couple permeates all aspects
of their private relations.
On the other hand, of course, they do not want to be completely
separated from the children's rooms. They also want to be
close to them, especially while the children are young. A mother
wants to run quickly to the bed of an infant in an emergency.
These problems can only be solved if there is a part of the
house, which we call the couple's realm; that is, a world in
which the intimacy of the man and woman, their joys and
sorrows, can be shared and Ii ved through. It is a place not only
insulated from the children's world, but also complete in itself, a

world, a domain. In many respects t s a version of the pattern
HOUSE FOR A COUPLE  7), embedded in the larger house with

The couple's realm needs to be the kind of place that one
might sit in and talk privately, perhaps with its own entrance to
the outdoors, to a balcony. It is a sitting room, a place for privacy,
a place for projects; the bed is part of it, but tucked away into an
alcove with its own window; a fireplace is wonderful; and it
needs some kind of a double door, an ante-room, to protect its
pnvacy.
Therefore:
Make a special part of the house distinct from the common
areas and all the children's rooms, where the man
and woman of the house can be together in private. Give
this place a quick path to the children's rooms, but, at all
costs, make it a distinctly separate realm.

areas: a COMMON AREA AT THE HEART  I )' a COUPLE'S REALM

area. If the common area and couple's realm are in position, it
is now possible to weave in this partly separate, partly overlapping
place for children, which we call a realm, although we
recognize that it is not a separate realm but more an aspect of
the house, reserved for children, a mode of functioning which is
physically separate only in certain parts. It is that component of
CONNECTED PLAY  which acts within the individual houses.

If children do not have space to release a tremendous

and everybody else in the family up the wall.
/ frenzy in the dining room.
For a graphic example, visualize what happens when children
bring in friends after school and have a whole number of ideas in
their heads of what to do or play. They are loud and boisterous
after being pent up in school all day and they need a lot of indoor
and outdoor space to expend all this energy. Obviously, the
mood calls for space which contains long distances because they
suggest the possibility of physical freedom much more.
IJ CHILDREN'S REALM
And, in general, the child's world is not some single space
or room-it is a continuum of spaces. The sidewalk where he
sells lemonade and talks with friends, the outdoor play area of
his house into which he can invite his friends, the indoor playspace,
his private space in the house where he can be alone with
a friend, the bathroom, the kitchen where his mother is, the
family room where the rest of the family is-for the child, all
of these together form his world. If any other kind of space
interrupts this continuum, it will be swallowed up into the
child's world as part of his circulation path.
If the private rooms, the couple's realm, the quiet sitting
areas are scattered randomly among the places that form the
children's world, then they will certainly be violated. But if
the children's world is one continuous swath, then these quiet,
private, adult places will be protected by the mere fact that they
are not part of the continuum. We therefore conclude that all
the places which children need and use should form one continuous
geometrical swath, which does not include the couple's
realm, the adult private rooms, or any formal, quiet sitting
spaces. This continuous playspace needs certain additional properties.
I. Children are apt to be very demanding of everyone's attention
when they are in this specially energetic state. The mother is
particularly susceptible to being totally swallowed up by them.
They will want to show her things, ask her questions, ask her to
do things ... "Look what I found. Look what I made. Where
shall I put this Where's the clayl Make some paint." The
mother must be available for all this, but not forced to be in the
thick of it. Her workroom and the kitchen need to be protected,
yet tangential to the playspace.
 The family room is also part of the continuum since it is
where children and the rest of the family have contact with each
other. The playspace, therefore, should enter the common areapreferably
to one side-sec COMMON AREA AT THE HEART  ).
 The children's private spaces whether they are alcoves or
bedrooms can be off the playspace, but it must be possible to
close them off. Children naturally want to be exclusive at timesthey
often invite their closest friends into such a space for a
private chat or to show off some prized possession.
BUILDINGS
 It is usually too expensive to create a special playspace; but
it is always possible to make a hallway function as the indoor part
of the playspace. It needs to be a bit wider than a normal hall
(perhaps seven feet with nooks and stages along the edge. Children
take up the suggestive qualities of spaces-on sight of a
little cave-like space, they will decide to play house; on sight of
a raised platform, they will decide to put on a play. Thus, both
indoor and outdoor parts of the playspace need different levels,
little nooks, counters, or tables, and so on. A lot of open storage
for toys, costumes, and so forth should also be provided in these
spaces. When toys are visible, they are more likely to be used.
 The outdoor space just adjacent to the indoor space should
be partially roofed, to provide transition between the two and to
reinforce the continuity.
Remember that this kind of playspace is as much in the interest
of the adults in the family, as in the interest of the children.
If the house is organized so that the children's world gradually
spreads throughout the home, it will disrupt and dominate the
world of tranquility, preciousness, and freedom that adults
need, to live their own lives. If there is an adequate children's
world, in the manner described in this pattern, then both the
adults and children can co-exist, each without dominating the
other.
Therefore:
Start by placing the small area which will belong entirely
to the children-the cluster of their beds. Place it in a
separate position toward the back of the house, and in
such a way that a continuous playspace can be made from
this cluster to the street, almost like a wide swath inside
the house, muddy, toys strewn along the way, touching
those family rooms which children need-the bathroom
and the kitchen most of all-passing the common area
along one side but leaving quiet sitting areas and the
couple's realm entirely separate and inviolate), reaching
out to the street, either through its own door or through the
entrance room, and ending in an outdoor room, connected

... at the back of the INTIMACY GRADIENT  I ), the pos1t1on

give some idea of where bedrooms will be. This pattern settles
the position of the bedrooms by pbcing them to face the east,
and thereby complements the effect of INDOOR SUNLIGHT  I ),
which places the more public rooms toward the south.
This is one of the patterns people most often disagree
with. However, we believe they are mistaken.
People's attitude to this pattern often runs along the following
lines: "The pattern suggests that I should sleep somewhere where
the sun can wake me up; but I don't want the sun to wake me
up; I want to be able to sleep late, whenever I can. I guess I
l1ave a different style of life; so the pattern doesn't apply to me."
We believe there may be fundamental biological matters at
stake here and that no one who once understands them will want
to ignore them, even if his present style of life does seem to
contradict them.
The facts, as far as we can tell, are these. Our human organism
contains a number of very sensitive biological clocks. We
are creatures of rhythms and cycles. Whenever we behave in a
way which is not in tune with our natural rhythms and cycles, we
run a very good chance of disturbing our natural physiological
and emotional functioning.
Specifically, these cycles have a great deal to do with sleep.
And the cycle of the sun governs our physiology to such an
extent, that we cannot afford to sleep out of touch with this
cycle. Consider the fact that the body reaches its lowest metabolic
activity in the middle of the sun's night, at about  A.M.
It seems very likely, then, that the most nourishing kind of
sleep is a sleep whose curve more or less coincides with the curve
of metabolic activity-which is in turn dependent on the sun.
It has recently been shown by Dr. London at tile San Francisco
Medical School, that our whole day depends critically on the
BUILDINGS
conditions under which we waken. If we wake up immediately
after a period of dreaming REM sleep), we will feel ebullient,
energetic, and refreshed for the whole day, because certain
critical hormones are injected into the bloodstream immediately
after REM sleep. If, however, we wake up during delta sleep
(another type of sleep, which happens in between periods of
dreaming), we will feel irritable, drowsy, flat, and lethargic all
day long: the relevant hormones are not in the bloodstream at
the critical moment of awakening.
Now, obviously, anyone who is woken by an alarm clock, will
sometimes be woken in the middle of delta sleep and will, on
those days, have a lethargic day; and will sometimes wake up just
after REM sleep and will, on those days, have an energetic day.
Of course this is tremendously oversimplified-many other
matters intervene. But if these facts about sleep are correct, they
cannot help but have some impact on your waking hours.
Now, the only way to make sure that you wake up at the
right time, with the closure of REM sleep, is to wake up naturally.
But you can only wake up naturally, and in accordance
with the other, larger cycle of metabolic activity, if you wake up
with the sun. The sun warms you, increases the light, gently
nudges you to wake up-but in a way that is so gentle, that you
will still actually wake up at the moment which serves you bestthat
is, just after a dream.
We believe, in short, that this pattern is fundamental to the
process of having a healthy, active, energetic day-and that anyone
who rejects this pattern on the grounds that he does not
want to be woken by the sun, is making a serious mistake about
the functioning of his or her own body.
What about details? You want to see the sunlight, but you
don't want the sun to shine on the bed itself or you'll wake up
hot and uncomfortable. The right kind of place is one which
provides morning light-consequently a window in the room that
lets in the eastern light-and a bed that provides a view of the
light without being directly in the light shaft.
And finally, the matter of the view from the bed is worth
mentioning. People look out in the morning to see what kind of
day its going to be. Some views give this information very well;
others not at all. A good morning window looks out on some kind

I   SLEEPING TO THE EAST
of constant object or growing thing, which reflects the changes of
season ,rnd the weather, and allows a person to establish the mood
of the day as soon as he wakes up.
Therefore,
Give those parts of the house where people sleep, an
eastern orientation, so that they wake up with the sun and
light. This means, typically, that the sleeping area needs to
be on the eastern side of the house; but it can also be on the
western side provided there is a courtyard or a terrace to the
east of it.

I  FARMHOUSE KITCHEN**

... you have laid out, or already have, some kind of common
area at the center of the building. In many cases, especially in
houses, the heart of this common area is a kitchen or an eating
area since shared food has more capacity than almost anything to
be the basis for communal feelings-COMMON AREA AT THE HEART
(129), COMMUNAL EATING ). This pattern defines an ancient
kind of kitchen where the cooking and the eating and the
living are all in a single place.
The isolated kitchen, separate from the family and considered
as an efficient but unpleasant factory for food is
a hangover from the days of servants; and from the more
recent days when women willingly took over the servants'
role.
In traditional soc1et1es, where there were no servants and the
members of a family took care of their own food, the isolated
kitchen was virtually unknown. Even when cooking was entirely
in the hands of women, as it very often was, the work of
cooking was still thought of as a primal, communal function;
and the "hearth," the place where food was made and eaten,
was the heart of family life.
As soon as servants took over the function of cooking, in the
palaces and manor houses of the rich, the kitchens naturally got
separated from the dining halls. Then, in the middle class
housing of the nineteenth century, where the use of servants became
rather widespread, the pattern of the isolated kitchen also
spread, and became an accepted part of any house. But when the
servants disappeared, the kitchen was still left separate, because it
was thought "genteel" and "nice" to eat in dining rooms away
from any sight or smell of food. The isolated kitchen was still
associated with those houses of the rich, where dining rooms like
this were taken for granted.
But this separation, in a family, has put the woman in a very
difficult position. Indeed, it may not be too much to say that it

BUILDINGS
has helped to generate those circumstances which have made the
woman's position in mid-twentieth century society unworkable
and unacceptable. Very simply, the woman who accepted responsibility
for making food agreed to isolate herself in the "kitchen"and
subtly then agreed to become a servant.
Modern American houses, with the so-called open plan, have
gone some way toward resolving this conflict. They very often
have a kitchen that is half-separated from the family room: not
isolated, and not entirely in the family room. This does create a
circumstance where the people who are cooking are in touch with
the rest of the family, while they are working. And it does not
have the obvious stigma and unpleasantness of separated sculleries
and kitchens.
But it does not go far enough. If we look beneath the surface,
there is in this kind of plan still the hidden supposition that
cooking is a chore and that eating is a pleasure. So long as this
mentality rules over the arrangement of the house, the conflict
which existed in the isolated kitchen is still present. The difficulties
which surround the situation will only disappear, finally,
when all the members of the family are able to accept, fully, the
fact that taking care of themselves by cooking is as much a part of
life as taking care of themselves by eating. This will only happen
when the communal hearth is once more gathered round the big
kitchen table, as it is in primitive communities, where the taking
care of necessary functions is an everyday part of life, and has not
been lost to people's consciousness through the misleading function
of the servant.
We are convinced that the solution lies in the pattern of the
old farmhouse kitchen. In the farmhouse kitchen, kitchen work
and family activity were completely integrated in one big room.
The family activity centered around a big table in the middle:
here they ate, talked, played cards, and did work of all kinds including
some of the food preparation. The kitchen work was done
communally both on the table, and on counters round the walls.
And there might have been a comfortable old chair in the
corner where someone could sleep through the activities.
Therefore:
Make the kitchen bigger than usual, big enough to in-

elude the "family room" space, and place it near the center
of the commons, not so far back in the house as an ordinary
kitchen. Make it large enough to hold a good big

and stove and sink around the edge of the room; and make
it a bright and comfortable room.

... among the common areas and sitting spaces-COMMON
AREAS AT THE HEART ), SEQUENCE OF SITTING SPACES 2)
-there is a need for one, at least, which puts the people in the
house in touch with the world of the street outside the house.
This pattern helps to create the HALF-HIDDEN GARDEN Irr and
gives life to the street-GREEN STREET   r or PEDESTR!AN
STREET roo).

The relationship of a house to a street is often confused:
either the house opens entirely to the street and there is no
privacy; or the house turns its back on the street, and communion
with street life is lost.
We have within our natures tendencies toward both communality
and individuality. A good house supports both kinds
of experience: the intimacy of a private haven and our participation
with a public world.
But most homes fail to support these complementary needs.
Most often they emphasize one, to the exclusion of the other: we
have, for instance, the fishbowl scheme, where living areas face
the street with picture windows and the "retreat," where living
areas turn away from th  street into private gardens.
The old front porch, in traditional American society, solved
this problem perfectly. Where the street is quiet enough, and
the house near enough to the street, we cannot imagine a much
better solution. But if the street is different, a slightly different
solution will be necessary.
Early in his career, Frank Wright experimented with one possible
solution. When he built beside lively streets he built a wide
terrace between the living room and the street.
To our knowledge, Grant Hildebrand first pointed out this
pattern in Wright's work, in his paper, "Privacy and Participation:
Frank Lloyd Wright and the City Street," School of

BUILDINGS
Section of pri-vatc terrace and street.
Architecture, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington:
 Hildebrand gives an interesting account of the way this
pattern works in the Cheney house:
As the pedestrian looks toward the house from the sidewalk, the
masonry terrace wall is located so that his line of sight over its
top falls at the lower edge of the elaborately leaded upper glass zone
of the terrace doors. Vision into the living room from the sidewalk
thus is carefully controlled. If the occupant within the house
is standing near the doors only his head and shoulders are dimly
visible through a diffusing surface. If the occupant is sitting he is, of
course, completely hidden from the pedestrian's view.
But whereas the pedestrian cannot effectively intrude on the
privacy of the house, the inhabitant on the other hand has a number
of options available at will. As he stands or sits on the terrace itself,
well above the sidewalk, the effect is of easy participation in the full
panorama of the street. From the elevated platform vision is unobstructed.
Neighbors and friends can be waved at, greeted, invited in
for a chat. Thus the terrace, projecting toward the street, linkedand
still links-the Cheney house and its inhabitants to the community
life of Oak Park. The configuration is so successful that; as
in the Robie house, there has never been much need for curtains. The
parapets and the leaded glass, carefully placed, do it all. Thus out of
the decision to face the living room toward the street has come not a
sacrifice of privacy, but a much richer range of alternative experiences
for the occupant.
We believe that Wright's use of this pattern was based on
accurate intuitions about a fundamental human need. Indeed,
there are empirical grounds for believing that the need for a
house to be in touch with the street outside is a fundamental
psychological necessity: and that its opposite-the tendency some
people have to keep their houses away from the street, Jocked
up, barred, and disconnected from the street-is a symptom of a
serious emotional disorder-the autonomy-withdrawal syndrome.
See Alexander, "The City as a Mechanism for Sustaining Human
Contact," W. Ewald, ed., Environment for Man, Indiana University
Press, 67, pp. 0-102.
Here is an example of this pattern from Greece. It is clear that

I PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET
the pattern can be expressed in many ways, so long as the relationship,
the balance of pri,·acy and street contact, is maintained.
Private terrace on the street.
Therefore:
Let the common rooms open onto a wide terrace or a
porch which looks into the street. Raise the terrace slightly
above street level and protect it with a low wall, which
you can see over if you sit near it, but which prevents
people on the street from looking into the common rooms.

If possible, place the terrace in a pos1t1on which is also congruent
with natural contours-TERRACED SLOPE  ). The wall,
if low enough, can be a SITTING WALL 3); in other cases,
where you want more privacy, you can build a full garden wall,
with openings in it, almost like windows, which make the connection
with the street-GARDEN WALL  I i3) HALF-OPEN WALL
(193). In any case, surround the terrace with enough things to
give it at least the partial feeling of a room-OUTDOOR ROOM
(163).
I  I A ROOM OF ONE'S OWN**

... the INTIMACY GRADIENT  I  makes it clear that every
house needs rooms where individuals can be alone. In any household
which has more than one person, this need is fundamental
and essential-THE FAMILY 5), HOUSE FOR A SMALL FAMILY
(76), HOUSE FOR A COUPLE 7). This pattern, which defines
the rooms that people can have to themselves, is the natural
counterpart and complement to the social activity provided for in
COMMON AREAS AT THE HEART  ).
No one can be close to others, without also having
frequent opportunities to be alone.
A person in a household without a room of his own will always
be confronted with a problem: he wants to participate in family
life and to be recognized as an important member of that group;
but he cannot individualize himself because no part of the house
is totally in his control. It is rather like expecting one drowning
man to save anoth.cr. Only a person who has a well-developed
strong personal self, can venture out to participate in communal
Ji fe.
This notion has been explored by two American sociologists,
Foote and Cottrell:
There is a critical point beyond which closer contact with another
person will no longer lead to an increase in ernpathy. A Up to a
certain point, intirnate interaction with others increases the capacity
to empathize with them. But when others are too constantly present,
the organism appears to develop a protective resistance to responding
to them .... This limit to the capacity to empathize should be
taken into account in planning the optimal size and concentration of
urban populations, as well as in planning the schools and the housing
of individual families. B Families who provide time and space for
privacy, and who teach chilrlren the utility and satisfaction of withdrawing
for private reveries, will show higher average empathic
capacity than those who do not. Foote, N. and L. Cottrell, Identity
and fn1erperso11al Competence, Chicago, 55, pp. 2-73, .)
Alexander Leighton has made a similar point, emphasizing
the mental damage that results from a systematic lack of privacy
BUILDINGS
["Psychiatric Disorder and Social Environment," Psychiatry, I
(3), P· 4, 55].
In terms of space, what is required to solve the problem?
Simply, a room of one's own. A place to go and close the door; a
retreat. Visual and acoustic privacy. And to make certain that the
rooms are truly private, they must be located at the extremities of
the house: at the ends of building wings; at the ends of the
INTIMACY GRADIENT  I   ; far from the common areas.
We shall now look at the individual members of the family
one at a time, in slightly more detail.
Wife. We put the wife first, because, classically, it is she who
has the greatest difficulty with this problem. She belongs everywhere,
and every place inside the house is in a vague sense hersyet
it is only very rarely that the woman of the house has a small
room which is specifically and exclusively her own. Virginia
Woolf's famous essay "A room of one's own" is the strongest and
most important statement on this issue-and has given this
pattern its name.
Husband. In older houses, the man of the house usually had a
study or a workshop of his own. However, in modern houses
and apartments, this has become as rare as the woman's own room.
And it is certainly just as essential. Many a man associates his
house with the mad scene of young children and the enormous
demands put on him there. If he has no room of his own, he has
to stay at his office, away from home, to get peace and quiet.
Teenagers. For teenage children, we have devoted an entire
pattern to this problem: TEENAGER'S COTTAGE 4). We have
argued there that it is the teenagers who are faced with the
problem of building a firm and strong identity; yet among the
adults, it is the young who are most often prevented from having
a place in the home that is clearly marked as their own.
Child1·en. Very young children experience the need for privacv
less-but they still experience it. They need some place to keep
their possessions, to be alone at times, to have a private visit with
a playmate. See BED CLUSTER  I 3 and BED ALCOVE   8).
John Madge has written a good survey of a family's need for
private space "Privacy and Social InterKtion," Transactions of
the Bartlett Society, Vol. , 64-65), and concerning the
children he says:
I4I A ROOM OF ONE'S OWN
The bedroom is often the repository of most of these items of
personal property around which the individual builds his own satisfactions
and which help to differentiate him from the other members
of the inner circle of his life-indeed he will often reveal them
more freely to a peer in age and sex than to a member of his own
family.
In summary then, we propose that a room of one's own-an
alcove or bed nook for younger children-is essential for each
member of the family. It helps develop one's own sense of
identity; it strengthens one's relationship to the rest of the
family; and ir creates personal territory, thereby building ties
with the house itself.
Therefore:
Give each member of the family a room of his own,
especially adults. A minimum room of one's own is an
alcove with desk, shelves, and curtain. The maximum
is a cottage-like a TEENAGER'S COTTAGE 4), or an OLD
AGE COTTAGE 5). In all cases, especially the adult ones,
place these rooms at the far ends of the intimacy gradientfar
from the common rooms.

small children, give them at least an alcove in the communal
sleeping area-BED ALCOVE  I 8); and for the man and woman,
give each of them a separate room, beyond the couples realm they
share; it may be an expanded dressing room-DRESSJNG ROOM
(189), a home workshop-HOME WORKSHOP ), or once
again, an alcove off some other room-ALCOVES  I ), WORKSPACE
ENCLOSURE 3). If there is money for it, it may even
be possible to give a person a cottage, attached to the main
structure-TEENAGER'S COTTAGE   4), OLD AGE COTTAGE  5).
In every case there must at least be room for a desk, a chair, and
THINGS FROM YOUR LIFE    ). And for the detailed shape of
the room, see LIGHT ON TWO SlDES OF EVERY ROOM    and
THE SHAPE OF INDOOR SPACE 1 . ...
I  SEQUENCE OF
SITTING SPACES*
... at various points along the INTIMACY GRADIENT  I  of a
house, or office, or a public building, there is a need for sitting
space. Some of this space may take the form of rooms devoted
entirely to sitting, like the formal sitting rooms of old; others
may be simply areas or corners of other rooms. This pattern states
the range and distribution of these sitting spaces, and helps create
the intimacy gradient by doing so.

Every corner of a building is a potential s1ttmg space.
But each sitting space has different needs for comfort and
enclosure according to its position in the intimacy gradient.
We know from INTIMACY GRADIENT  that a building has
a natural sequence of spaces in it, ranging from the most public
areas, outside the entrance, to the most private, in individual
rooms and couples realms. Here is a sequence of sitting spaces that
would correspond roughly to the INTIMACYG RADIENT(  ):

BUILDINGS
Now, what is the problem? Simply, it is the following. People
have a tendency to think about the sitting room, as though a
building, and especially a house, has just one room made for
sitting. Within this frame of reference, this one sitting room gets
a great deal of care and attention. But the fact that human activity
naturally occurs all through the house, at a variety of degrees of
intensity and intimacy, is forgotten-and the sitting spaces
throughout the building fail to support the real rhythms of sitting
and hanging around.
To solve the problem, recognize that your building should
contain a sequence of sitting spaces of varying degrees of intimacy,
and that each space in this sequence needs the degree of enclosure
and comfort appropriate to its position. Pay attention to the full
sequence, not just to one room. Ask yourself if the building you
are making or repairing has the full sequence of sitting spaces,
and what needs to be done to create this sequence, in its full
richness and variety.
Of course, you may want to build a special sitting room-a sala
or a parlor or a library or a living room-as one of the sitting
spaces in your house. But remember that each office and workroom
needs a sitting space too; so does a kitchen, so does a couple's
realm, so does a garden, so does an entrance room, so does a
corridor even, so does a roof, so does a window place. Pick the
sequence of sitting spaces quite deliberately, mark it, and pay
equal attention to the various spaces in the sequence as you go
further into the details of the design.
Therefore:
Put in a sequence of graded s1ttmg spaces throughout
the building, varying according to their degree of enclosure.
Enclose the most formal ones entirely, in rooms by themselves;
put the least formal ones in corners of other rooms,
without any kind of screen around them; and place the
intermediate one with a partial enclosure round them to
keep them connected to some larger space, but also partly
separate.

 BED CLUSTER*
... the sleeping areas have been defined to be inside the
COUPLE'S REALM    and CHILDREN'S REALM   ). Beyond
that, they are in places facing cast to get the morning lightSLEEPING
TO THE EAST   ). This pattern defines the grouping
of the beds within the sleeping areas, and also helps to generate
the general sleeping areas themselves.
Every child in the family needs a private place, generally
centered around the bed. But in many cultures, perhaps all
cultures, young children feel isolated if they sleep alone,
if their sleeping area is too private.
Let us consider the various possible configurations of the
children's beds. At one extreme, they can all be in one room-one
shared bedroom. At the other extreme, we can imagine an arrangement
in which each child has a private room. And then, in
between these two extremes, there is a kind of configuration in
which children have their own, small, private spaces, not as
large as rooms, clustered around a common playspace. We shall
try to show that both extremes are bad; and that some version of
the cluster of alcoves is needed to solve the conflict between
forces in a young child's life.
Tl,ree configurations: the shared bedroom, isolated rooms,
a cluster of alcoves.
We first discuss the one room version. The problems in this
case are obvious. Children are jealous of one another's toys; they
fight over the light, the radio, the game being played, the door
open or closed. In short, for young children, especially in that
BUILDINGS
age when feelings of possession and control are developing, the
one room with many beds is just too difficult.
In the effort to avoid these difficulties, it is not surpnsmg
that many parents go to the other extreme-if they can afford it
-an arrangement in which each child has his own room. But this
creates new difficulties, of an entirely different sort: Young
children feel isolated when they are forced to be alone.
The need for contact in the sleeping area is particularly true
in strongly traditional cultures like Peru and India, where even
adults sleep in groups. In these countries, people simply do not
like to feel isolated and draw a great deal of comfort and security
from the fact that they are constantly surrounded by people.
But even in "privacy-oriented" cultures like the United States,
where isolation is common and taken for granted, children, at
]east, feel the same way. They prefer to sleep in the company of
others. For instance, we know that little children like to leave
their door ajar at night, and to sleep with some light on; they
like to go off to sleep hearing the voices of the adults around
the house.
This instinct is so strongly developed in children of all cultures,
that we believe it may be unhealthy for little children to
have whole rooms of their own, regardless of cultural habit. It is
very easy for a cultural relativist to argue that it depends on the
cultural setting, and that a culture which puts high value on
privacy, self-sufficiency, and aloneness, might very well choose to
put each child in his own room in order to foster these attitudes.
However, in spite of this potentially reasonable cultural relativism,
it seems to us that although adults do need their own
rooms, the isolation of a private room for a small child may perhaps
be fundamentally incompatible with healthy psycho-social
development; and might even do organic damage. It is significant
that there is no culture in the world except the United States,
and the offshoots of the United States, where this one-child-oneroorn
pattern is widely practiced. And our observations do certainly
suggest that this pattern is correlated with emotional
withdrawal, and exaggerated conceptions of the individual's selfsufficiency,
which, in the end, bring a person into inner conflicts
between the need for contact and the need for withdrawal.
We thus face two conflicting forces. Children need some
I4J BED CLUSTER
privacy, some way of retreating from endless squabbles about
territory, some way of having a miniature version of the adult's
"room of his own." Yet at the same time, they also need extensive,
almost animal, contact with others-their talk, their care,
their touch, their sound, their smell.
We believe that this conflict can only be resolved in an
arrangement which gives them the opportunity for both; an
arrangement of individual spaces which they "own," clustered
around a common playspace so that they are all in sight and
sound of one another, never too alone. In a culture with relatively
little need for privacy, the clustered beds can get enough privacy
by being set into simple, curtained bed-alcoves, see BED ALCOVE
( I 8). In a culture where people have a strong need for privacy,
the clustered beds may be in tiny rooms, surrounding a communal
space.
Finally, two examples: One shows the way one lay-designer,
working with this pattern language, interpreted this pattern. The
other shows a cluster of beds in a Breton farmhouse.
Two homemade bed clusters.
Therefore:
Place the children's beds m alcoves or small alcove-like
rooms, around a common playspace. Make each alcove
large enough to contain a table, or chair, or shelves-at least
some floor area, where each child has his own things. Give
the alcoves curtains looking into the common space, but
not walls or doors, which will tend once more to isolate
the beds too greatly.

specifications of CHILDREN'S REALM  I  ), and make the path

... this pattern defines and places the main bathroom of a
building. It does it by changing the present character of bathing
rooms completely: And its position is so clear, and so essential,
that it will probably help to form the sleeping areas and public
areas given by larger patterns: INTIMACY GRADIENT  I  ), COMMON

"The motions we call bathing are mere ablutions which
formerly preceded the bath. The place where they are performed,
though adequate for the routine, does not deserve
to be called a bathroom."
Bernard Rudofsky
Rudofsky points out that cleaning up is only a small part of
bathing; that bathing as a whole is a far more basic activity,
with therapeutic and pleasurable aspects. In bathing we tend to
ourselves, our bodies. It is one of the precious times when we
are awake and absolutely naked. The relaxation of the bath puts
us into sensual contact with water. It is one of the most direct and
simple ways of unwinding. And, most astonishing, there is even
evidence that we become less warlike when we tend to ourselves
and our children in this way.
Cross culturally there is a correlation between the degree to which a
society places restrictions on bodily pleasure-particularly in childhood-
and the degree to which the society engages in the glorification
of warfare and sadistic practices. Philip Slater, Pursuit of
Loneliness, Boston: Beacon Press,  70, pp.  -90.)
We ought to remember ... that the thermae of old, with their
routine of daily regeneration, were as much a matter of course to
their users as our restaurants are to us. Only more so; they were
considered indispensable. In the fourth century, the city of Rome

I  BATH ING ROOM
A Finnish sauna.
But bathing for pleasure has had a hard history. It went underground
with the Reformation of the Church, the Elizabethan
Era, and Puritanism. It became a "scapegoat" for the evils of
society-immorality, ungodliness, and disease. It is strange that
we have not yet recovered from such nonsense. Contrast our
approach to the bath, tub, and shower with these words, written in
 by Nikos Kazantzakis, the Greek novelist and poet, after his
first Japanese bath:
I feel unsurpassed happiness. I put on the kimono, wear the
wooden sandals, return to my room, drink more tea, and, from the
open wall, watch the pilgrims as they go up the road beating
drums .... I have overcome impatience, nervousness, haste. I enjoy
every single second of these simple moments I spend. Happiness, I
think, is a simple everyday miracle, like water, and we are not aware
of it.
We start, then, with the assumption that there are strong and
profound reasons for making something pleasant out of bathing,
and that there is something quite wrong with our present way of
building several small and separate bathrooms, one for the master
bedroom, one for children, perhaps one near the living rooIT,each
one of them a compact efficient box. These separate, efficiency
bathrooms never give a family the chance to share the
intimacies and pleasures of bathing, of being naked and halfnaked
together. And yet, of course, this sharing has its limits.
House guests and casuai visitors must be able to use the bathroom
too; and one bathroom will not work for a whole family, if any
one person can lock the door and keep it to himself. Yet if we
imagine a large bathing room, large enough to make bathing a

BUILDINGS
pleasure, we see that we can certainly not afford more than one
of them per family.
How can all these problems be resolved! In order to resolve
them, we shall list the various forces which seem to be acting.
Then we can untangle them.
I. First, the newly re-emerging force, which we have named
already-the growing desire that people have to make their
bathing into a positive re-generating pleasure.
 Second, an increasing relaxation about nakedness, which
makes it possible to imagine members of a family, and their
friends, and even strangers, sharing a bath.
 Third, the fact that this increasing relaxation has its limits;
and that the limits are different for every person. Some people
still want to be able to keep their nakedness private: they must
be able to have a shower, or use the toilet, unseen, when they
want to.
 The fact that the habit of putting toilets in bathrooms not
next to them as they used to be), springs from the convenience of
passing to and fro between the toilet and the bath-or showerwithout
dressing and undressing to go out into a passage. People
want to be comfortably naked while they are in the bathroomgoing
into the bathroom, going from the toilet to the bath, shaving,
and so on. It is a nuisance to have to dress simply to negotiate any
one of these connections.
 And yet, the members of the family must be able to pass
between bedrooms and bathroom, in various stages of undress,
without passing through public areas. This is especially true of
the adults.
 And visitors must be able to use the bathing room, and must
therefore be able to reach it without passing through the private
rooms or bedrooms.
The fundamental conflict in these forces seems to be between
openness and privacy. There are reasons to draw the functions of
the bathroom together, and reasons to keep them separate. This
suggests that all the functions of the bathroom be drawn together
to form a suite, that th is suite or bathing room be conceived of
as the only bathroom in the house, but that private realms be
created within this suite, where people can shut a door or pull a
curtain and be private.
I  BATHING ROOM
We imagine the entire bathing room tiled and protected from
other parts of the house, and the public outdoors. Within this
space it is possible to achieve the right connections between the
bath itself and the other parts of the bathing room, and yet keep
the bathing room proper open to people who want to use only
the sink, the shower, or the toilet. We suggest that the room
be placed next to the couple's realm-they will use it most-but
also between the public part of the house and the private part
of the house, so that the path from the family commons to the
bathing room does not pass through the bedrooms or private
workspace. And make sure paths from bedrooms to bathroom do
not pass through any area which is visible from the common
rooms.
A simple way to cope with the subtleties of nakedness and
gowns is to give the bathing room prominent towel racks in
several places, each with a few giant towels, towels that people
can wrap up in. Under these circumstances a person can simply
throw a towel around himself and twist it together when he is
uneasy about his nakedness, and otherwise let it drop. This is
far better than the formal robes, which are always in the wrong
place, and are too much like dressing.
The bath itself should be large enough so that two or three
people can get themselves comfortably in the water-so that
you feel like staying, not rushing in and out. Light helps a lot.
If privacy is an issue, natural light can filter through translucent
glass; or a window with clear glass can overlook a private garden.
Finally, a word about the doors: It is important to place them
correctly, as they do the most to establish the subtle balance between
openness and privacy. We imagine solid unlockable doors to
the bathing room as a whole; perhaps swinging doors to establish
the fluidity of the area; and then opaque glass doors or curtains on
the shower stall; a simple door for the toilet stalls-th is is the most
private spot; and an open doorway to the alcove which contains
the bath. The sinks and the towels, the shelves, and all the other
odds and ends are in the tiled outer zone.
Therefore:
Concentrate the bathing room, toilets, showers, and
basins of the house in a single tiled area. Locate this bathing

room beside the couple's realm-with private access-in a
position half-way between the private secluded parts of the
house and the common areas; if possible, give it access to
the outdoors; perhaps a tiny balcony or walled garden.
Put in a large bath-large enough for at least two people
to get completely immersed in water; an efficiency shower
and basins for the actual business of cleaning; and two or
three racks for huge towels-one by the door, one by the
shower, one by the sink.

FAMILY  6), SELF-GOVERNING WORKSHOPS AND OFFICES 0),
and INDIVIDUALLY OWNED SHOPS 7). More generally, it is
needed to fill out every BUILDING COMPLEX   ).
In houses and workplaces there is always some need for
bulk storage space; a place for things like suitcases, old
furniture, old files, boxes-all those things which you are
not ready to throw away, and yet not using everyday.
Some old buildings provide for this kind of storage automatically,
with their attics, cellars, and sheds. But very often
this kind of storage space is overlooked. We Ii nd it neglected, for
example, in carefully designed buildings, where the designer is
watching the square foot costs closely and cannot justify an extra
room that is not "living space."
In our experience, however, bulk storage space is terribly important;
and when it is not provided, it usually means that
some other space becomes the receptacle for all the bulky, marginal
things that people need to store.
How much bulk storage should be provided  Certainly there
should not be too much of it. That only invites us to keep old
things that we have long since finished with. But some bulk
storage is essential. Any household or workshop or cluster will
have old furniture to store until it can be fixed, old tires, books,
chests, tools that are only occasionally used; and the more selfsufficient
the household is, the more space it needs. In the extreme
case, it is even necessary to have space for storing building
materials  The amount needed is never less than JO per cent
of the built area-sometimes as high as  per cent-and
normally I  to  per cent.
BUILDINGS
Therefore:
Do not leave bulk storage till last or forget it. Include
a volume for bulk storage in the building-its floor area at
least  to  per cent of the whole building area-not less.
Place this storage somewhere in the building where it
costs less than other rooms-because, of course, it doesn't
need a finish.

OFFICE CONNECTIONS 2). Once again, as in a house, the most
basic layout of all is given by INTIMACY GRADIENT  I   and
COMMON AREAS AT THE HEART  I ). Within their general
framework, this pattern helps to define the working space m
more detail, and so completes these larger patterns.

Is it possible to create a kind of space which is specifically
tuned to the needs of people working, and yet capable of an
infinite number of various arrangements and combinations
within it?
Every human organization goes through a series of changes.
In offices, the clusters of work groups, their size and functions,
are all subject to change-often unpredictably. How must office
space be designed to cope with this situation/
The standard approaches to the problem of flexibility in office
spaces are:   uninterrupted modular space with modular partitions
(full height or half-height and  entire floors of uninterrupted
space with low ceilings and no partitions known as
"office landscape").
But neither of these solutions really work. They are not
genuinely flexible. Let us analyze them in turn.
We discuss the partition solution first. In a na'ive sense, it
seems obvious that the problem can be solved by movable partitions.
However, in practice there are a number of serious difficulties.
I. If partitions are made easy to move, they become lightweight
and provide inadequate acoustic insulation.
 If the partitions are both easy to move and acoustically
insulated, they are usually very expensive.
I  FLEXIBLE OFFICE SPACE
 The actual cost of moving a partition is usually so high that
even in highly "flexible" and "modular" systems, the partitions
are in fact very rarely moved.
 Most serious of all: it is usually not possible to make minor
changes in a partition system. At the moment when one working
group expands and needs more space, it is only by rare accident
that the working group next door happens at this same moment to
be contracting. In order to make room for the expanding group,
a large part of the office must be reshuffled, but this causes so
much disruption that many office managements adopt the simpler
solutions-they leave the partitions as they are and move the
people.
 Finally, It IS m the nature of office space that certain Informal,
semi-permanent arrangements grow more permanent over
time for example, furnishing, filing systems, "ownership" of
special spaces or windows). This makes the occupants resistant
to change. Though they may be willing to move when the growth
of their own working group is at stake, they will resist moving
strongly, as part of any general office reshuffle, caused by the expansion
or contraction of some other working group.
The modular partition system fails because the partitions become,
in effect, ordinary walls; yet they arc less useful than real
walls for defining territory and for sound insulation; and what is
more, the partitions do not necessarily satisfy the need for a semienclosed
workspace, discussed in WORKSPACE ENCLOSURE  I  ).
It is clear, then, that systems of movable partitions do not really
solve the problem.
The office landscape solution, since it has no partitions, is more
genuinely flexible. However, this system is only suitable for
types of work which reguire neither a high degree of privacy
nor much internal cohesion within individual working groups.
Moreover, studies by Brian Wells have made it clear that office
workers strongly prefer small work spaces to larger ones-see
SMALL WORK GROUPS  ). Wells shows that, when given a
choice among different sized offices, people choose desks in small
offices rather than large ones. And he shows that working groups
in small offices are much more cohesive  defined by a larger percentage
of internal sociometric choices), than the working groups
in large offices. Pilkington Research Unit, Office De;ign: A
BUILDINGS
Study of Environmwt, Department of Building Science, University
of Liverpool, 65, pp. 13-21.)
It seems then, that neither flexible partitions nor office landscape,
really works. Neither creates space that is both well-adapted
to specific work arrangements and truly flexible. A clue to an altogether
different approach to flexibility comes from the fact that
organizations which use converted houses as office space have no
difficulty with this problem at all. Indeed, it appears that these
old buildings actually provide more real flexibility than the
apparent flexibility of modular partitioned offices. The reason is
simple. In these old houses, there are many small rooms, a few
large rooms, and many partially defined spaces, usually interconnected
in a variety of ways.
Mixture of room sizes.
Though these spaces were designed to support family life, they
turn out also to support the natural strncture of work groups:
there are small spaces for private and half-private offices, slightly
larger spaces for work groups of two to six, usually one space
where up to I  people can gather, and a commons cente ed
around the kitchen and dining room. Furthermore, within each
space there are usually a variety of walls, half-walls, window
seats, which allow for changes within the rooms.
Although the walls cannot be moved at a moment's notice-the
house is genuinely adaptable. Changes in work groups can be
made in a few minutes, at no cost, just by opening and closing
doors. And the acoustic characteristics are excellent-since most
of the walls are soE.:l, often load-bearing walls.
It is occasionally possible to build an office or a workspace like
I  FLEXIBLE OFFICE SPACE
a house-when you know enough about the working group ahead
of time to base the mix of rooms and larger spaces on their
specific nature. But, far more often, the work groups which will
occupy the space are unknown at the time the space is built. In
this case, no specific "house-like" design is possible. Instead, it is
necessary to design and build a type of space which can gradually,
and systematically, be turned into this needed house-like kind of
space once it is occupied.
The kind of space which will create this possibility is not
"warehouse" space or "office landscape" space but instead, a kind
of space which contains the possibility that people need, in the
form of columns and ceiling height variety, to encourage them
to modify it as they use it. If there are columns, so placed, that
a few partitions nailed to the columns will begin to form
differentiations and rooms within rooms, then we can be sure
that people will actually transform it to meet their needs once
they begin to work there.
As far as the geometrical layout of the columns is concerned,
we have found that it works best when there is essentially a
central space-with aisles down the sides-and the possibility of
forming the bays of the aisles into workspaces. The illustration
below shows the general idea, together with the ways this pattern
may be transformed after a few years.
n •7
t
Adding partitions.
Of course, you can add rooms of different sizes and combine
spaces to follow this general outline in an almost endless variety
of ways. In one case they may be rather simple, with bays laid out
in rows. In another case, the bays may twist and turn, with odd
sized rooms and spaces in between. The details are irrelevant.
What matters is the general position of the columns and, of
course, the guarantee that they are placed in such a way that

there is plenty of natural light inside-LIGHT ON TWO SIDES OF
EVERY ROOM  I ),
Therefore:
Lay out the office space as wings of open space, with free
standing columns around their edges, so they define halfprivate
and common spaces opening into one another. Set
down enough columns so that people can fill them in over
the years, in many different ways-but always in a semipermanent
fashion.
If you happen to know the working group before you
build the space, then make it more like a house, more
closely tailored to their needs. In either case, create a variety
of space throughout the office-comparable in variety to the
different sizes and kinds of space in a large old house.

 COMMUNAL EATING*
... this pattern helps complete all those human groups and
institutions which have COMMON AREAS AT THE HEART  I  in
them, and most of all it helps to complete workshops and offices
and extended families-THE FAMILY   ), SELF-GOVERNING
WORKSHOPSA ND OFFICES 0). In all of them, the common area
will draw its strength from the sharing of food and drink. This
pattern defines it in detail, and shows also how it helps to
generate a larger social order.
Without communal eating, no human group can hold together.
The importance of communal eating is clear in all human
societies. Holy communion, wedding feasts, birthday parties,
Christmas dinner, an Irish wake, the family evening meal are
Western and Christian examples, but every society has its
equivalents. There are almost no important human events or
institutions which are not given their power to bind, their sacral
character, by food and drink. The anthropological literature is
full of references. For example: "Food and Its Vicissitudes: A
Cross-Cultural Study of Sharing and Nonsharing," in Yehudi
A. Cohen, Social Structure and Personality: A Casebook, New
York: Holt, 61. Audrey I. Richards, Hunger and Work in a
Savage Tribe: A Functional Study of Nutrition Among the
Southern Bantu. Glencoe, Ill.: Free Press,  .
Thomas Merton summarizes the meaning of communal eating
beautifully:
A feast is of such a nature that it draws people to itself, and
makes them leave everything else in order to participate in its joys.
To feast together is to bear witness to the joy one has at being with
his friends. The mere act of eating together, quite apart from a
banquet or some other festival occasion, is by its very nature a sign
of friendship and of "communion."
In modern times we have lost sight of the fact that even the
most ordinary actions of our everyday life are invested, by their
very nature, with a deep spiritual meaning. The table is in a
BUILDINGS
certain sense the center of family life, the expression of family
life. Here the children gather with their parents to eat the food which
the love of their parents has provided ....
So, too, with a banquet. The Latin word convivium contains
more of this mystery than our words "banquet" or "feast." To call
a feast a "convivium" is to call it a "mystery of the sharing of
life"-;,, mystery in which guests partake of the good things prepared
and given to tliein by the love of their host, and in which the atmosphere
of friendship and gratitude expands into a sharing of
thoughts and sentiments, and ends in common rejoicing. Thomas
Merton, The Living Bread, New York, 56, pp. -27.)
It is clear, then, that communal eating plays a vital role in
almost all human societies as a way of binding people together
and increasing the extent to which they feel like "members" of a
group.
But beyond this intrinsic importance of communal eating, as
a way of binding the members of a group together, there is
another important reason for maintaining the pattern, which
applies especially to modern metropolitan society.
Metropolitan society creates the possibility of meeting a
wonderful variety of people, a possibility almost entirely new in
human history. In a traditional society, one learns to live with
the people he knows, but the people he knows form a relatively
closed group; there is little possibility of expanding it greatly. In
a modern metropolitan society, each person has the possibility of
finding those few other people in the city he really wants to be
with. In theory, a man in a city of five million people has the
possibility of meeting just those half dozen people who are the
people he most wants to be with, in all of these five million.
But this is only theory. In practice it is very hard. Few people
can feel confident that they have met their closest possible
companions or found the informal groups they want to belong to
in the cities they inhabit. In fact, on the contrary, people complain
constantly that they cannot meet enough people, that there
are too few opportunities for meeting people. Far from being
free to explore the natures of all the people in society, and free
to be together with those others who have the greatest natural
and mutual affinities, instead people feel constrained to be with
the few people they happen to have run into.
I   COM MUN AL EATING
How can the great potential of metropolitan society be realized?
How can a person find the other people for whom he has
the greatest possible affinity I
To answer this question, we must define the workings of the
process by which people meet new people in society. The answer
to this question hinges on the following three critical hypotheses:
r. The process hinges entirely on the overlap of the human
groups in society, and the way a person can pass through these
human groups, expanding his associations.
 The process can only take place if the various human groups
in society possess "group territories" where meeting can take
place.
 The process of meeting seems to depend especially on communal
eating and drinking and therefore takes place especially
well in those groups which have at least partly institutionalized
common food and drink.
If these three hypotheses arc correct, as we believe, then it is
plain that the process by which people meet one another depends
very largely on the extent to which people are able to pass from
group to group, as visitors and guests, at communal meals. And
this of course can happen only if each institution and each social
group has its own common meals, regularly, and if its members arc
free to invite guests to their meals and in turn are free to be
invited by the guests they meeet-to other meals at other gatherings.
Therefore:
Give every institution and social group a place where
people can eat together. Make the common meal a regular
event. In particular, start a common lunch in every work
place, so that a genuine meal around a common table not
out of boxes, machines, or bags becomes an important,
comfortable, and daily event with room for invited guests.
In our own work group at the Center, we found this
worked most beautifully when we took it in turns to
cook the lunch. The lunch became an event: a gathering:
something that each of us put our love and energy into,
on our day to cook.

... within the workspace of an institution-SELF-GOVERNING
WORKSHOPS AND OFFICES  0), FLEXIBLE OFFICE SPACE  I ),
there need to be still further subdivisions. Above all, as this
pattern shows, it is essential that the sma_llest human working
groups each have their own physical space.
When more than half a dozen people work in the same
place, it is essential that they not be forced to work in one
huge undifferentiated space, but that instead, they can
divide their workspace up, and so form smaller groups.
In fact, people will feel oppressed, both when they are either
working in an undifferentiated mass of workers and when they
are forced to work in isolation. The small group achieves a
nice balance between the one extreme in which there are so
many people, that there is no opportunity for an intimate social
structure to develop, and the other extreme in which there arc
so few, that the possibility of social groups does not occur at all.
This attitude toward the size of work groups is supported by
the findings of the Pilkington Research Unit, in their investigations
of office life Office Design: A Study of Environment, ed.
Peter Manning, Department of Building Science, University of
Liverpool, 65, pp. 04-28). In a very large study indeed,
office workers were asked their opinions of large offices and small
offices. The statements they chose most often to describe their
opinions were: "The larger offices make one feel relatively unimportant"
and "There is an uncomfortable feeling of being watched
all the time in a large office." And when asked to compare live
different possible layouts for offices, workers consistently chose
those layouts in which workgroups .vere smallest.
The five layouts in order of preference.

I  SMALL WORK GROUPS
Analysis of the results also showed that "the people who work
in small office areas are more opposed to large office areas than
those who actually work in them." Apparently, once people have
had the experience of working in small groups, they find it very
uncomfortable to imagine going back to the larger office settings.
In our own survey of attitudes toward workspace-taken among
workers at the Berkeley City Hall-we found that people prefer
to be part of a group that ranges from two to eight. When
there are more than eight, people lose touch with the group as a
human gathering; and almost no one likes working alone.
A similar finding is reported by the Japanese architect,
T. Takano, in his study of work groups in Japan. In the offices
he studied, he found that five persons formed the most useful
functional group. Building Section, Building and Repairs Bureau,
Min is try of Construction: The Design of Akita prefect □ ral
government office, Public Buildings, 61.)
How should these small groups be related to each other? Brian
Wells points out that while small offices support an intimate
atmosphere, they do not support communic tions between groups.
"The Psycho-Social Influence of Building Environment" Building
Science, Vol. I, Pergamon Press, I  , p. I  ). It would seem
that this problem can be solved by arranging the small work groups
so that several of them share common facilities: drinking fountains,
toilets, office equipment, perhaps a common anteroom and
garden.
Therefore:
Break institutions into small, spatially identifiable work
groups, with less than half a dozen people in each. Arrange
these work groups so that each person is in at least
partial view of the other members of his own group; and
arrange several groups in such a way that they share a common
entrance, food, office equipment, drinking fountains,
bathrooms.

in a public building, or an office where there are many
people coming in, SELF-GOVERNING WORKSHOPS AND OFFICES
( 0), SMALL SERVICES WITHOUT RED TAPE   I), TRAVELER'S INN
(  I), FLEXIBLE OFFICE SPACE   )-the place inside the
ENTRANCE ROOM 0 plays an essential role; it must be built
from the very start with the right atmosphere. This pattern was
originally proposed by Clyde Dorsett of the National Institute
of Mental Health, in a program for community mental health
clinics.
Have you ever walked into a public building and been
processed by the receptionist as if you were a package?
To make a person feel at ease, you must do the same for him
as you would do to welcome him to your home; go toward him,
greet him, offer him a chair, offer him some food and drink, and
take his coat.
In most institutions the person arriving has to go toward the
receptionist; the receptionist remains passive and offers nothing.
To be welcoming the receptionist must initiate the action-come
forward and greet the person, offer a chair, food, a seat by the
fire, coffee. Since it is first impressions which count, this whole
atmosphere should be the first thing a person encounters.
A beautiful example we know is the reception desk at Browns
Hotel in London. You pass into the hotel through a small, unassuming
entrance, not unlike the entrance to a house. You pass
through two or three rooms; then come to the central room in
which there are two old writing desks. The receptionist comes
forward from an inner office, invites you to sit down in a comfortable
chair at one of these writing desks, and sits down with
you while you fill out the hotel register.
BUILDINGS
The reasons most reception areas fail completely to have this
quality, is that the receptionist's desk forms a barrier, so that the
desk and equipment together help to create an institutional atmosphere,
quite at odds with the feeling of welcome.
Therefore:
Arrange a series of welcoming things immediately inside
the entrance-soft chairs, a fireplace, food, coffee. Place
the reception desk so that it is not between the receptionist
and the welcoming area, but to one side at an angle-so
that she, or he, can get up and walk toward the people
who come in, greet them, and then invite them to sit down.

 A PLACE TO WAIT*
in any office, or workshop, or public service, or station, or
clinic, where people have to wait-INTERCHANGE ), HEALTH
CENTER  ), SMALL SERVICES WITHOUT RED TAPE   I), OFFICE
CONNECTIONS   z), it is essential to provide a special place for
waiting, and doubly essential that this place not have the sordid,
enclosed, time-slowed character of ordinary waiting rooms.
The process of waiting has inherent conflicts in it.
On the one hand, whatever people are waiting for-the doctor,
an airplane, a business appointment-has built in uncertainties,
which make it inevitable that they must spend a long time hanging
around, waiting, doing nothing.
On the other hand, they cannot usually afford to enjoy this
time. Because it is unpredictable, they must hang at the very
door. Since they never know exactly when their turn will come,
they cannot even take a stroll or sit outside. They must stay in
the narrow confine of the waiting room, waiting their turn. But
this, of course, is an extremely demoralizing situation: nobody
wants to wait at somebody else's beck and call. Kafka's greatest
works, The Castle and The Trial, both deal almost entirely with
the way this kind of atmosphere destroys a man.
The classic "waiting room" does nothing to resolve this
problem. A tight dreary little room, with people staring at each
other, fidgeting, a magazine or two to flip-this is the very
situation which creates the conflict. Evidence for the deadening
effect of this situation comes from Scott Briar "Welfare From
Below: Recipients' Views of the Public Welfare System," in
Jacobus Tenbroek, ed., The Law and the Poor, San Francisco:
Chandler Publishing Company, I 66, p.  z). We all know that
time seems to pass more slowly when we are bored or anxious or
restless. Briar found that people waiting in welfare agencies consistently
thought they had been waiting for longer than they really
had. Some thought they had been wating four times as Jong.
The fundamental problem then, is this. How can the people
I   A PLACE TO WAIT
who are waiting, spend their time wholeheartedly-live the
hours or minutes while they wait, as fully as the other hours of
their day-and yet still be on hand, whenever the event or the
person they are waiting for is ready!
It can be done best when the waiting is fused with some other
activity: an activity that draws in other people who are not there
essentially to wait-a cafe, pool tables, tables, a reading room,
where the activities and the sears around them are within earshot
of the signal that the interviewer or the plane, or whatever is
ready. For example, the Pediatrics Clinic at San Francisco
General Hospital built a small playground beside the entrance, to
serve as a waiting area for children and a play area for the
neighborhood.
Waiting room at t!te pediatrics clinic.
In another example we know, a horseshoe pit was built alongside
a terrace where people came to wait for appointments. The
people waiting inevitably started pitching horseshoes, others
joined in, people lefr as their appointments came up-there was
an easy flow between the horseshoe pit, the terrace, and the
offices.
Waiting can also be a situation where the person waiting finds
himself with free time, and, with the support of the surroundings,
is able to draw into himself, become still, meditative-quite the
opposite of the activity described above.
The right atmosphere will come naturally if the waiting area
provides some places that are quiet, protected, and do not draw
out the anxiety of the wait. Some examples: a seat near a bus
BUILDINGS
stop, under a tree, protected from the street; a window seat that
looks down upon a street scene below; a protected seat in a
garden, a swing or a hammock; a dark place and a glass of beer,
far enough away from passages so that a person is not always
looking up when someone comes or goes; a private seat by a fish
tank.
In summary, then, people who are waiting must be free to do
what they want. If they want to sit outside the interviewer's door,
they can. If they want to get up and take a stroll, or play a game
of pool, or have a cup of coffee, or watch other people, they can.
If they want to sit privately and fall into a daydream, they can.
And all this without having to fear that they are losing their
place in line.
Quiet waiting.
Therefore:
In places where people end up waiting for a bus, for an
appointment, for a plane), create a situation which makes
the waiting positive. Fuse the waiting with some other
activity-newspaper, coffee, pool tables, horseshoes; something
which draws people in who are not simply waiting.
And also the opposite: make a place which can draw a person
waiting into a reverie; quiet; a positive silence.

I  I SMALL MEETING ROOMS*

... within organizations and workplaces-UNIVERSITY AS A
MARKETPLACE 3), LOCAL TOWN HALL 4), MASTER AND
APPRENTICES   ), FLEXIBLE OFFICE SPACE  I ), SMALL WORK
GROUPS  I ), there will, inevitably, be meeting rooms, group
rooms, classrooms, of one kind or another. Investigation of meeting
rooms shows that the best distribution-both by size and by position-
is rather unexpected.
The larger meetings are, the less people get out of
them. But institutions often put their money and attention
into large meeting rooms and lecture halls.
We first discuss the sheer size of meetings. It has been shown
that the number of people in a group influences both the number
who never talk, and the number who feel they have ideas which
they have not been able to express. For example, Bernard Bass
(Organizational Psychology, Boston: Allyn, 65, p. 00 has
conducted an experiment relating group size to participation. The
results of this experiment are shown in the following graph.

size of group
As size of group grows, more anrl more people l,olrl back.
There is no particularly natural threshold for group size; but
it is clear that the number who never talk climbs very rapidly. In
a group of I , one person never talks. In a group of , there are
six people who never talk.
We get similar thresholds when we consider comfortable
distances for talking. Edward Hall has established the upper
BUILDINGS
range for full casual voice at about  feet; a person with 0/ 0
vision can see details of facial expression up to   feet; two people
whose heads are  to  feet apart, can pass an object if they both
stretch; clear vision  that is, macular vision includes I  degrees
horizontally and  degrees vertically-which includes one face
but not two, at distances up to about  feet. See Edward Hall,
The Silent Language, New York: Doubleday, 66, pp. I I -19.)
Thus a small group discussion will function best if the members
of the group are arranged in a rough circle, with a maximum
diameter of about  feet. At this diameter, the circumference of
the circle will be   feet. Since people require about   inches
each for their seats, there can be no more than about I  people
round the circle.
Next we shall present evidence to show that in institutions and
workgroups, the natural history of meetings tends also to converge
on this size.
The following histograms show the relative numbers of different
sized classes held at the University of Oregon in the Fall of 70
and the relative numbers of available classrooms in the different
size ranges. We believe these figures are typical for many universities.
But it is obvious at a glance that there are too many
large classrooms and too few small classrooms. Most of the classes
actually held are relatively small seminars and "section" meetings,
while most of the classrooms are in the  to I  size range.
These large classrooms may have reflected the teaching methods of

an earlier period, but apparently they do not conform to the actual
practice of teaching in th.e r97o's.
We found that the meetings of official committees, boards, and
commissions in the City of Berkeley have a similar distribution.
Among the various city boards, commissions, and committees, 3
per cent have an average attendance of I  or less. Yet of course,
most of these meetings are held in rooms designed for far more
than I  people. Here again, most of the meetings are held in
rooms that are too large; the rooms are half-empty; people tend
to sit at the back; speakers face rows of empty seats. The intimate
and intense atmosphere typical of a good small meeting cannot
be achieved under these circumstances.
Finally, the spatial distribution of meeting rooms is often as
poorly adapted to the actual meetings as th.e size distribution. The
following histograms compare the distribution of classrooms in
different sectors of the University of Oregon with the distribution

Once again, this discrepancy has a bad effect on the social life
of small meetings. The meetings work best when the meeting
rooms are fairly near the participants' offices. Then discussions
which begin in the meeting rooms are able to continue in the
office or the laboratory. vVhen the meeting rooms are a long
walk from offices, the chances of this kind of informal business are
drastically reduced.
Therefore:
Make at least  per cent of all meeting rooms really
small-for  people or less. Locate them in the most public
parts of the building, evenly scattered among the workplaces.

this pattern shapes the individual rooms and offices. The pattern
also helps to generate the organization of these larger patterns.
What is the right balance between privacy and connection
in office work?
The totally private office has a devastating effect on the flow
of human relationships within a work group, and entrenches the
ugly quality of office hierarchies. At the same time, there are
moments when privacy is essential; and to some extent nearly
every job of work needs to be free from random interruption.
Everyone who has experienced office work reports some version
of this problem. In our own experience-as members of a
working team of architects-we have faced the problem in hundreds
of ways. The best evidence we have to report is our own
experience as a work group.
Over the last seven years we moved our offices on several occasions.
At one point we moved to a large old house: large
enough for some of us to have private rooms and others to share
rooms. In a matter of months our social coherence as a group was
on the point of breakdown. The workings of the group became
formalized; easy-going communication vanished; the entire atmosphere
changed from a setting which sustained our growth
as a group to an office bureaucracy, where people made appointments
with each other, left notes in special boxes, and nervously
knocked on each other's doors.
For a while we were virtually unable to produce any interesting
work.
It gradually dawned on us that the environment of the house
was playing a powerful role in the breakdown. As we started to
pay attention to it, we noticed that those rooms which were
still functioning-the places where we would all gather to talk
BUILDINGS
over the work-had a special characteristic: they were only halfprivate,
even though the workspaces with in them were strongly
marked.
As we thought it out, it seemed that almost every place
where we had found ourselves working well together had these
characteristics: no office was entirely private; most offices were for
more than one person; but even when an office was only for one,
it had a kind of simple common area at its front and everyone
felt free to drop in and stay for a moment. And the desks themselves
were always built up as private domains within and toward
the edges of these offices, so that doors could always be left wide
open. Eventually we rearranged ourselves until each person
had some version of this pattern.
The pattern works so well, that we recommend it to everyone
in similar circumstances.
Therefore:
Avoid closed off, separate, or private offices. Make every
workroom, whether it is for a group of two or three people
or for one person, half-open to the other workgroups and
the world immediately beyond it. At the front, just inside
the door, make comfortable sitting space, with the actual
workspace(s away from the door, and further back.

add those small outbuildings which must be

( I ): in general it makes any building flexible, useful in a
greater variety of circumstances.
❖ + ❖
As the life in a building changes, the need for space
shrinks and swells cyclically. The building must be able to
adapt to this irregular increase and decrease in the need
for space.
Very simply, when a family or a workgronp shrinks because
one or two people leave, the space which becomes empty should
be able to find a use. Otherwise, the people who stay behind will
rattle around in a hollow shell which is too big for them. They
may even be forced to sell their property and move because they
cannot afford the upkeep of so big a place.
And by the same token, since swelling and shrinking is almost
always unpredictable, this splitting off of space should be reversible.
The rooms which are given to outside use or let out when
they are not used, may one day be needed again when circumstances
change and the workgroup or family swells in size again.
To give buildings this flexibility, it is essential that parts of
them be relatively independent. In effect, some rooms should be
conceived in advance as potential rooms to let if the size of the
group should change. These rooms need a kind of connection to
the rest of the house, which allows them to be closed off and
separated, and then, just as easily, joined up again. Generally,

I  ROOMS TO RENT
this means a private entrance from the outside, either a private
bath or direct access to a bathroom, and perhaps access to the
kitchen.
In Denmark, Ole Dybbroe has developed a scheme for housing
that takes this pattern as a crucial generator of th.e form of the
house. The houses he shows in Enfamiliehuset I Landsbankernes
Reallanefond, stiftedes den . maj 59 grow slowly,
and each part of them can either be united with the larger
household or inhabited as an independent unit. Here is his plan
for a "four part" house.
Dybbroe's four-part house.
Though renting in general has a devastating impact on the
environment-see YOUR OWN HOME   our experience has
been that face-to-face rental, with the owners occupying the
main structure, is the one kind of rental relationship that is
reasonably healthy. The landlord is actually there, so he is directly
concerned with the well-being of the life around him and
with the environment, unlike the absentee landlords, who own
property only for the money which it makes. And the tenants are
usually short-term tenants, who prefer to rent a room rather
than take on burdens of ownership. Even here a more ideal
situation would be for the owner to share out ownership over
some part of the building, with certain options for taking back
the space. However, in the absence of such subtle forms of legal
ownership, face to face renting is, we believe, the only form of
renting that is not socially and physically destructive.

BUILDINGS
Therefore:
Make at least some part of the building rentable: give it
a private entrance over and above its regular connection to
the rest of the house. Make sure that the regular entrance
can be easily closed off without destroying the circulation
in the house, and make sure that a bathroom can be directly
reached from this room without having to go through the
main house.

... in any house which has teenagers in it-THE FAMILY 5),
HOUSE FOR A SMALL FAMILY 6)-it is necessary to give special
consideration to their rooms-A ROOM OF ON E's OWN  I  I). If
possible, these rooms should be attached but separate, and made to
help create the possibility of later being ROOMST o RENT  I  ).
If a teenager's place in the home does not reflect his
need for a measure of independence, he will be locked m
conflict with his family.
In most family homes the rooms for children and adolescents
are essentiaUy the same. But when children become adolescents,
their relationship to the family changes considerably. They become
less and less dependent on the family; they take on greater
responsibilities; their life outside the home becomes richer, more
absorbing. Most of the time they want more independence; occasionally
they really need the family to fall back on; sometimes
they are terrified by the confusion within and around them. All
of this places new demands on the organization of the family
and, accordingly, on the organization of the house.
To really help a young person go through. this time, home life
must strike a subtle balance. It must offer tremendous opportunities
for initiative and independence, as well as a constant sense
of support, no matter what happens. But American family life
never seems to strike this balance. The studies of adolescent
family life depict a time of endless petty conflict, tyranny, delinquency,
and acquiescence. As a social process, adolescence, it
seems, is geared more to breaking the spirit of young boys and
girls, than to helping them find themselves in the world. ee, for
example, Jules Henry, Culture Against Man, New York: Random
House, 63.)
In physical terms these problems boil down to this. A teenager
needs a place in the house that has more autonomy and character
and is more a base for independent action than a child's bedroom
or bed alcove. He needs a place from which he can come
I   TEENAGER'S COTTAGE
and go as he pleases, a place within which his privacy is respected.
At the same time he needs the chance to establish a closeness with
his family that is more mutual and less strictly dependent than
ever before. What seems to be required is a cottage which, in its
organization and location, strikes the balance between a new
independence and new ties to the family.
The teenager's cottage might be made from the child's old
bedroom, the boy and his father knocking a door through the
wall and enlarging the room. It might be built from scratch,
with the intention that it later serve as a workshop, or a place
for grandfather to live out his life, or a room to rent. The cottage
might even be an entirely detached structure in the garden, but
in this case, a very strong connection to the main house is
essential: perhaps a short covered path from the cottage into the
main kitchen. Even in row housing, or apartments, it is possible to
give teenagers rooms with private entry.
Is the idea of the teenage cottage acceptable to parents? Silverstein
interviewed I  mothers living in Foster City, a suburb of
San Francisco, and asked them whether they would like a teenage
cottage in their family. Their resistance to the idea revolved
around three objections:
I. The cottage would be useful for only a few years, and
would then stand empty.
 The cottage would break up the family; it isolates the
teenager.
 It gives the teenager too much freedom in his comings and
goings.
Silverstein then suggested three modifications, to meet these
objections:
To meet the first objection, make the space double as a workshop,
guest room, studio, place for grandmother; and build it
with wood, so it can be modified easily with hand tools.
To meet the second objection, attach the cottage to the house,
but with its own entrance; attach the cottage to the house via a
short hall or vestibule or keep the cottage to the back of the lot,
behind the house.
To meet the third objection, place the cottage so that the
path from the room to the street passes through an important
communal part of the house-the kitchen, a courtyard.

He discussed these modifications with the same twelve
mothers. Eleven of the twelve now felt that the modified version
had some merit, and was worth trying. This material is reported
by Murray Silverstein, in "The Boy's Room: Twelve Mothers
Respond to an Architectural Pattern," University of California,
Department of Architecture, December 67.
Here are some possible variants containing these modifications.

And finally, from Simone De Beauvoir:
When I was twelve I had suffered through not having a private
retreat of my own at home. Leafing through Mon Journal I had
found a story about an English schoolgirl, and gazed enviously at

the colored illustration portraying her room. There was a desk, and
a divan, and shelves filled with books. Here, within these gaily
painted walls, she read and worked and drank tea, with no one
watching her-how envious I felt! For the first time ever I had
glimpsed a more fortunate way of life than my own. And now, at
long last, I too had a room to myself. My grandmother had stripped
her drawing room of all its armchairs, occasional tables, and knickknacks.
I had bought some unpainted furniture, and my sister had
helped me to give it a coat of brown varnish. I had a table, two
chairs, a large chest which served both as a seat and as a hold-all,
shelves for my books. I papered the walls orange, and got a divan to
match. From my fifth-floor balcony I looked out over the Lion of
Belfort and the plane trees on the Rue Denfert-Rochereau. I kept
myself warm with an evil-smelling kerosene stove. Somehow its
stink seemed to protect my solitude, and I loved it. It was wonderful
to be able to shut my door and keep my daily life free of other
people's inquisitiveness. For a long time I remained indifferent to the
decor of my surroundings. Possibly because of that picture in Mon
Journal I preferred rooms that offered me a divan and bookshelves,
but I was prepared to put up with any sort of retreat in a pinch.
To have a door that I could shut was still the height of bliss for
me ... I was free to come and go as I pleased. I could get home
with the milk, read in bed all night, sleep till midday, shut myself
up for forty-eight hours at a stretch, or go out on the spur of the
moment ... my chief delight was in doing as I pleased. Simone
De Beauvoir, The Prime of Life, New York: Lancer Books, 66,
pp. -10.)
Therefore:
To mark a child's coming of age, transform his place
in the home into a kind of cottage that expresses in a
physical way the beginnings of independence. Keep the
cottage attached to the home, but make it a distinctly
visible bulge, far away from the master bedroom, with
its own private entrance, perhaps its own roof.

 OLD AGE COTTAGE**
... we have explained, in OLD PEOPLE EVERYWHERE  0), that
it is essential to have a balanced number of old people in every
neighborhood, partly centered around a communal place, but
largely strung out among the other houses of the neighborhood.
This pattern now defines the nature of the houses for old people
in more detail: both those which are a part of clusters and those
which are tucked, autonomously, between the larger houses. As
we shall see, it seems desirable that every family should have a
cottage like this, attached to it-THE FAMILY 5). Like ROOMS
TO RENT 3 and TEENAG!::R's COTfAGE 4), this cottage
can be rented out or used for other purposes in time of trouble.
Old people, especially when they are alone, face a terrible
dilemma. On the one hand, there are inescapable forces
pushing them toward independence: their children move
away; the neighborhood changes; their friends and wives
and husbands die. On the other hand, by the very nature of
aging, old people become dependent on simple conveniences,
simple connections to the society about them.
This conflict is reflected often in their children's conflict. On
the one hand, children feel responsible for their parents, because,
of course, they sense their growing need for care and comfort. On
the other hand, as families are whittled down, parent-child conflicts
become more acute, and few people can imagine actually
being able or willing to take care of their parents in their dotage.
The conflict can be partly resolved, if each house which houses
a nuclear family has, somewhere near it, a small cottage where
a grandparent can live, far enough away to be independent, and
yet close enough to feel some tie and to be cared for in a time of
trouble or approaching death.
But the conflict is more general. Even if we ignore, altogether,
the complexities of parent-child relationships, the fact is that most
old people face enormous difficulties as they grow older. The wel-

I OLD AGE COTTAGE
fare state tries to replace the comfort of the extended family
with payments-social security or pensions. This income is
always tiny; and inflation makes it worse. In the United States,
one-quarter of the population over  lives on less than $ a
year. Many of the old people in our society are forced to live in
miserable tiny rooms, way in the back of some run-down old
folks hotel. They cannnot have a decent house, because there are
no decent tiny houses compatible with a small income and reduced
activity.
This second conflict, between the need for someplace really
small and modest and the need for social contact, a view of passing
people, someone to nod to, a place in the sun, can also be
resolved, like the first conflict, by cottages. It can be resolved,
if there are many tiny cottages, dotted among the houses of
communities and always strung along pedestrian paths-tiny
enough to be really cheap.
Therefore:
Build small cottages specifically for old people. Build
some of them on the land of larger houses, for a grandparent;
build others on individual lots, much smaller
than ordinary lots. In all cases, place these cottages at
ground level, right on the street, where people are walking
by, and close to neighborhood services and common
land.

... as people grow older, simple satisfying work which nourishes,
becomes more and more important. Th is pattern specifies
the need for th is development to be a part of every family. It
helps to form THE FAMILY   ), it helps form OLD AGE COTTAGE
( I  ), and it is a natural embellishment of A ROOM OF ON E's OWN
(141).

The experience of settled work is a prerequisite for peace
of mind in old age. Yet our society undermines this experience
by making a rift between working life and retirement,
and between workplace and home.
First of all, what do we mean by "settled work"' It is the
work which unites all the threads of a person's life into one
activity: the activity becomes a complete and wholehearted extension
of the person behind it. It is a kind of work that one cannot
come to overnight; but only by gradual development. And
it is a kind of work that is so thoroughly a part of one's way of
life that it most naturally occurs within or very near the home:
when it is free to develop, the workplace and the home gradually
fuse and become one thing.
It may be the same kind of work that a man has been doing all
his life-but as settled work it becomes more profound, more concrete,
and more unique. For example, there is the bureaucrat
who finally breaks through all the paper work and finds the
underlying organic function in his wo:k. Then he begins to let
this function into the world. This is the theme of Kurosawa's
most beautiful film, !kiru: To Live. Or it may be work that a
person begins in his spare time, away from his occupation, and
it gradually expands and becomes more involving, until it replaces
his old occupation altogether.
The problem is that very many people never achieve the
experience of settled work. This is essentially because a person,

I  SETTLED WORK
during his working life, has neither the time nor the space to
develop it. In today's marketplace most people arc forced to
adapt their work to the rules of the office, the factory, or the institution.
And generally this work is all-consuming-when the weekends
come people do not have the energy to start a new, demanding
kind of work. Even in the self-governing workshops and
offices, where working procedures are created ad hoc by the
workers as they go, the work itself is generally geared to the
demands of the marketplace. It does not allow time for the slow
growth of "settled work"-which comes from within and may
not always carry its weight in the marketplace.
To solve the problem, we must first of all create a working environment,
where a person, from say middle age, has the opportunity
of slowly developing a kind of settled work that is right
for him. For instance, if people were able to take off one day
a week, with half-time pay, beginning at the age of 0, they
could gradually set up for themselves a workshop in their home or
in their neighborhood. If the time is increased gradually over
the years, a person can explore various kinds of work; and, then,
gradually let the settled work replace his working life.
We make special mention of settled work as the work of old
age, because, even though it must begin early on in a person's life,
it is in old age that having such work becomes a necessity. The
crisis of old age, life integrity versus despair and cynicism, can
only be solved by a person engaged in some form of settled work
-see LIFE CYCLE  ). People who h:ive the opportunity to
develop such work and to relate it in some appropriate way to
the world about them, will find their way to a successful resolntion
of this crisis as they grow old; others will sink into despair.
Therefore:
Give each person, especially as he grows old, the chance
to set up a workplace of his own, within or very near his
home. Make it a place that can grow slowly, perhaps in
the beginning sustaining a weekend hobby and gradually
becoming a complete, productive, and comfortable workshop.

I  HOME WORKSHOP

... at the center of each HOUSE CL USER    and in YOUR
OWN HOME  there needs to be one room or outbuilding, which
is freely attached and accessible from the outside. This is the
workshop. The following pattern tells us how important workshops
are, how widely they ought to be scattered, how omnipresent,
and when they are built, how easy to reach, and how
public they should always be. It helps to reinforce the patterns of
SCATTERED WORK  ), NETWORK OF LEARNING  ), and MEN
AND WOMEN ).

As the decentralization of work becomes more and more
effective, the workshop in the home grows and grows in
importance.
We have explained in SCATTERED WORK ), NETWORK OF
LEARNING ), MEN AND WOMEN ), SELF-GOVERNING
WORKSHOPS AND OFFICES So), and other patterns that we
imagine a society in which work and family are far more intermingled
than today; a society in which people-businessmen,
artists, craftsmen, shopkeepers, professionals-work for themselves,
alone and in small groups, with much more relation to their immediate
surroundings than they have today.
In such a society, the home workshop becomes far more than a
basement or a garage hobby shop. It becomes an integral part of
every house; as central to the house's function as the kitchen or
the bedrooms. And we believe its most important characteristic
is its relationship to the public street. For most of us, work life
is relatively public. Certainly, compared to the privacy of the
hearth, it is a public affair. Even where the public relationship is
slight, there is something to be gained, both for the worker and
the community, by enlarging the connection between the two.
In the case of the home workshop, the public nature of the
work is especially valuable. It brings the workshop out of the
realm of backyard hobbies and into the public domain. The
people working there have a view of the street; they are exposed

I  HOME WORKSHOP
to the people passing by. And the people passing learn something
about the nature of the community. The children especially are
enlivened by this contact. And according to the nature of the
work, the public connection takes the form of a shopfront, a
driveway for loading and unloading materials, a work bench in
the open, a small meeting room . . .
We therefore advocate provision for a substantial workshop
with all the character of a real workplace and some degree of
connection to the public street: at least a glancing connection
so that people can see in and out; and perhaps a full connection,
like an open shop front.
Therefore:
Make a place in the home, where substantial work can
be done; not just a hobby, but a job. Change the zoning
laws to encourage modest, quiet work operations to locate
in neighborhoods. Give the workshop perhaps a few
hundred square feet; and locate it so it can be seen from
the street and the owner can hang out a shingle.

OPEN STAIRS*

... most of the last patterns-ROOMS TO RENT  3), TEENAGER'S
COTTAGE  I 4), SETTLED WORK  I ), HOME WORKSHOP
( I   )-can be upstairs, provided that they have direct connections
to the street. Far more generally, it is true that many of the
households, public services, and workgroups given by earlier
patterns can be successful when they lie upstairs, only if they are
given direct connections to the street. For instance, in a work
community SELF-GOVERNING WORKSHOPS AND OFFICES So),
SMALL SERVICES WITHOUT RED TAPE  I), SMALL WORK GROUPS
( I  all require direct access to the public street when they are
on the upper storys of a building. And in the individual households-
HOUSE FOR A SMALL FAMILY  6), HOUSE FOR A COUPLE
(77), HOUSE FOR ONE PERSON  also need direct connections
to the street, so people do not need to go through lower floors to
get to them. This pattern describes the open stairs which may be
used to form these many individual connections to the street.
They play a major role in helping to create PEDESTRIAN STREETS
( I 00).
Internal staircases reduce the connection between upper
stories and the life of the street to such an extent that they
can do enormous social damage.
The simple fact of the matter is that an apartment on the
second floor of a building is wonderful when it has a direct stair
to the street, and much less wonderful when it is merely one of
several apartments served by an internal stair. The following,
perhaps rather laborious discussion, is our effort to explain this
vital and commonplace intuition.
In a traditional culture where buildings are built incrementally,
outdoor stairs leading to upper stories are common. And half "outdoor"
stairs-protected by walls and roofs, but nonetheless open
to the street-are also common.

BUILDINGS
The beauty of open stairs.
By contrast, in industrialized, authoritarian societies most
stairs are indoor stairs. The access to these stairs is from internal
lobbies and corridors; the upper stories are cut off from direct
access to the life of the street.
T !tis is not an open stair-don't be fooled.
This difference is not an incidental by-product of fire laws or
construction techniques. It is fundamen ta! to the difference between
a free anarchical society, in which there is a voluntary
exchange of ideas between equals, and a highly centralized
authoritarian society, in which most individuals are subservient
to large government and business organizations.
In effect we are saying that a centralized entrance, which
funnels everyone in a building through it, has in its nature the
trappings of control; while the pattern of many open stairs,
leading off the public streets, direct to private doors, has in its
nature the fact of independence, free comings and goings.

 OPEN STAIRS
We can see this most easily in the cases where the centralized
door is, without question, a source of social control. In workplaces
with a central entrance and a time-clock, workers punch
in and out, and they have to make excuses when they are leaving
at a time that is not normal. In some kinds of student housing,
people are asked to sign in and out; and if they are not back by
"lock-out" time, they are in trouble.
Then there are cases where the control is more subtle. In an
apartment house or a workplace where everyone is free to come or
go as he pleases it is not uncommon for the main door to be kept
locked. Of course the residents have a key to the building; but
their friends do not. When the front door is locked-after normal
hours, say-they are effectively cut off from the spontaneous
"dropping in" that can occur freely only where all paths arc
public right up to the thresholds of private territory.
Then there is the still more subtle fact that, even where the
centralized entrance carries with it no explicit policy of social
control-let us say that it is a door that is always open-it still
has an uneasy feeling about it for people who cherish basic
liberties. The single, centralized entrance is the precise pattern
that a tyrant would propose who wanted to control people's
comings and goings. It makes one uneasy to live with such a form,
even where the social policy is relatively free.
This may very easily sound paranoid. But the point is this:
socially, a libertarian society tries to build for itself structures
which cannot easily be controlled by one person or one group "at
the helm." It tries to decentralize social structures so that there
are many centers, and no one group can come to have excessive
control.
A physical environment which supports the same libertarian
ideal will certainly put a premium on structures that allow people
freedom to come and go as they please. And it will try to protect
this right by building it into the very ground plan of buildings
and cities. When we feel uneasy in a building that is spatially
over-centralized and authoritarian, it is because we feel unprotected
in this way; we feel that one of our basic rights is potentially
vulnerable and is not being fully affirmed by the physical
structure of the environment.
Open stairs which act as extensions of the public world and
which reach up to the very threshold of each household's and each

BUILDINGS
workgroup's own space solve this problem. These spaces are then
connected directly to the world at large. People on the street
recognize each entry as the domain of real people-not the
domain of corporations and institutions, which have the actual
or potential power to tyrannize.
Therefore:
Do away, as far as possible, with internal staircases in
institutions. Connect all autonomous households, public
services, and workgroups on the upper floors of buildings
directly to the ground. Do this by creating open stairs
which are approached directly from the street. Keep the
stair roofed or unroofed, according to climate, but at all
events leave the stair open at ground level, without a door,
so that the stair is functionally a continuation of the street.
And build no upstairs corridors. Instead, make open landings
or an open arcade where upstairs units share a single
stair.

... once the building's major rooms are in pos1t1on, we have
to fix its actual shape: and this we do essentially with the i:,osition
of the edge. The edge has got its rough position already from
the overall form of the building-WINGS OF LIGHT  07), POSITIVE
OUTDOOR SPACE 06), LONG THIN HOUSE 09), CASCADE
OF ROOFS 16). This pattern now completes the work of WINGS
oF LICHT  07), by placing each individual room exactly where
it needs to be to get the light. It forms the exact line of the
building edge, according to the position of these individual
rooms. The next pattern starts to shape the edge.
When they have a choice, people will always gravitate to
those rooms which have light on two sides, and leave the
rooms which are lit only from one side unused and empty.
This pattern, perhaps more than any other single pattern,
determines the success or failure of a room. The arrangement of
daylight in a room, and the presence of windows on two sides, is
fundamental. If you build a room with light on one side only, you
can be almost certain that you are wasting your money. People
will stay out of that room if they can possibly avoid it. Of course,
if all the rooms are lit from one side only, people will have to use
them. But we can be fairly sure that they are subtly uncomfortable
there, always wishing they weren't there, wanting to leave-just
because we are so sure of what people do when they do have the
choice.
Our experiments on this matter have been rather informal and
drawn out over several years. We have been aware of the idea for
some time-as have many builders. We have even heard that
"light on two sides" was a tenet of the old Beaux Arts design
tradition. In any case, our experiments were simple: over and
over again, in one building after another, wherever we happened
to find ourselves, we would check to see if the pattern held.
Were people in fact avoiding rooms lit only on one side, preferring
the two-sided rooms-what did they think about it/

BUILDINGS
We have gone through this with our friends, in offices, in
many homes-and overwhelmingly the two-sided pattern seems
significant. People are aware, or half-aware of the pattern-they
understand exactly what we mean.
With ligl,t on two sides .... and without
If this evidence seems too haphazard, please try these observations
yourself. Bear the pattern in mind, and examine all the
buildings you come across in your daily life. We believe that you
will find, as we have done, that those rooms you intuitively
recognize as pleasant, friendly rooms have the pattern; and those
you intuitively reject as unfriendly, unpleasant, are the ones
which do not have the pattern. ln short, this one pattern alone, is
able to distinguish good rooms from unpleasant ones.
The importance of this pattern lies partly in the social atmosphere
it creates in the room. Rooms lit on two sides, with natural
light, create less glare around people and objects; this lets us see
things more intricately; and most important, it allows us to read in
detail the minute expressions that flash across people's faces, the
motion of their hands ... and thereby understand, more
clearly, the meaning they are after. The light on two sides allows
people to understand each other.
In a room lit on only one side, the light gradient on the walls
and floors inside the room is very steep, so that the part furthest
from the window is uncomfortably dark, compared with the part
near the window. Even worse, since there is little reflected light
on the room's inner surfaces, the interior wall immediately next
to the window is usually dark, creating discomfort and glare
against this light. In rooms lit on one side, the glare which surI
 LIGHT ON TWO SIDES OF EVERY ROOM
rounds people's faces prevents people from understanding one
another.
Although this glare may be somewhat reduced by supplementary
artificial lighting, and by well-designed window reveals, the
most simple and most basic way of overcoming glare, is to give
every room two windows. The light from each window illuminates
the wall surfaces just inside the other window, thus reducing the
contrast between those walls and the sky outside. For details and
illustrations, see R. G. Hopkinson, Architectural Physics: Lighting,
London: Building Research Station, 63, pp. , 03.
A supreme example of the complete neglect of this pattern is
Le Corbusier's Marseilles Block apartments. Each apartment unit
is very long and relatively narrow, and gets all its light from one
end, the narrow end. The rooms are very bright just at the
windows and dark everywhere else. And, as a result, the glare
created by the light-dark contrast around the windows is very
disturbing.
In a small building, it is easy to give every room light on two
sides: one room in each of the four corners of a house does it
automatically.
In a slightly larger building, it is necessary to wrinkle the
edge, turn corners, to get the same effect. Juxtaposition of large
rooms and small, helps also.
Wrinkle the edge.
In an even larger building, it may be necessary to build in
some sort of systematic widening· in the plan or to convolute the
edge still further, to get light on two sides for every room.

BUILDINGS
But of course, no matter how clever we are with the plan, no
matter how carefully we convolute the building edge, sometimes
it is just impossible. In these cases, the rooms can get the effect
of light on two sides under two conditions. They can get it, if
the room is very shallow-not more than about eight feet deep
-with at least two windows side by side. The light bounces off
the back wall, and bounces sideways between the two windows,
so that the light still has the glare-free character of light on two
sides.
And finally, if a room simply has to be more than eight feet
deep, but cannot have light from two sides-then the problem can
be solved by making the ceiling very high, by painting the walls
very white, and by putting great high windows in the wall, set
into very deep reveals, deep enough to offset the glare. Elizabethan
dining halls and living rooms in Georgian mansions were
often built like this. Remember, though, that it is very hard to
make it work.
Therefore:
Locate each room so that it has outdoor space outside it
on at least two sides, and then place windows in these outdoor
walls so that natural light falls into every room from
more than one direction.

high, if it is shallow compared with the length of the window

deep reveals on the windows to make quite certain that the big

I  BUILDING EDGE**

... assume that the position of the building edge is fixed-most
recently by LIGHT ON TWO SIDES OF EVERY ROOM   )-and
before that by the position of the building wings and their interior
spaces and by the courts and gardens and streets between
the buildings-WINGS OF LIGHT  I 07), POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE
( I 06). This pattern now sets the stage for the development of the
zone between the indoors and the outdoors. Often this "zone" is
thought of as an edge, a line on paper without thickness, a wall.
But this is altogether wrong ...
A building is most often thought of as something which
turns inward-toward its rooms. People do not often think
of a building as something which must also be oriented
toward the outside.
But unless the building is oriented toward the outside, which
surrounds it, as carefully and positively as toward its inside, the
space around the building will be useless and blank-with the
direct effect, in the long run, that the building will be socially
isolated, because you have to cross a no-man's land to get to it.
Look, for example, at this machine age slab of steel and glass.
You cannot approach it anywhere except at its entrancebecause
the space around it is not made for people.
The edge cannot support any life.

BUILDINGS
And compare it with this older, warmer building, which has a
continuous surrounding of benches, galleries, balconies, flowers,
corners to sit, places to stop. This building edge is alive. It is
connected to the world around it by the simple fact that it is
made into a positive place where people can enjoy themselves.
Think of the effect of this small difference. The machine-like
building is cut off from its surroundings, isolated, an island. The
building with a lively building edge, is connected, part of the
social fabric, part of the town, part of the lives of all the people
who live and move around it.
We get empirical support for this contrast from the following:
apparently people prefer being at the edges of open spaces-and
when these edges are made human, people cling to them tenaciously.
In observing people's behavior in outdoor spaces, for example,
Jan Gehl discovered that "there is a marked tendency for
both standing and sitting persons to place themselves near something-
a facade, pillar, furniture, etc." ["Mennesker til Fods
(Pedestrians)," A rkitekten, No. 0, I 68.] This tendency for
people to stay at the edges of spaces, is also discussed in the
pattern ACTIVITY POCKETS  I ).
If this propensity were taken as seriously outdoors as it is
indoors, then the exterior walls of buildings would look very
different indeed from the way they look today. They would be

 BUILDING EDGE
more like places-walls would weave in and out, and the roof
would extend over them to create little places for benches,
posters, and notices for people to look at. For the niches to
have the right depth, they would have to be occasionally as
much as  feet deep-see the arguments for SIX-FOOT BALCONY
(167).
When it is properly made, such an edge is a realm between
realms: it increases the connection between inside and outside,
encourages the formation of groups which cross the boundary,
encourages movement which starts on one side and ends on the
other, and allows activity to be either on, or in the boundary
itself. A very fundamental notion.
Therefore:
Make sure that you treat the edge of the building as a
"thing," a "place," a zone with volume to it, not a line or
interface which has no thickness. Crenelate the edge of
buildings with places that invite people to stop. Make places
that have depth and a covering, places to sit, lean, and
walk, especially at those points along the perimeter which
look onto interesting outdoor life.

... this pattern helps to embellish and give life to any
SOUTH FACING OUTDOORS Io  ; and, in a situation where the
outdoors is not to the south, but east or west, it can help to
modify the building so that the effective part of the outdoors
moves towards the south. It also helps to complete BUILDlNG EDGE
(160), and to place OUTDOOR ROOM 3).

The area immediately outside the building, to the south
-that angle between its walls and the earth where the
sun faHs-must be developed and made into a place which
lets people bask in it.
We have already made the point that important outdoor areas
should be to the south of buildings which they serve, and we
presented the empirical evidence for this idea in souTH FACING
OUTDOORS Io ). But even if the outdoor areas around a building
are toward the south, this still won't guarantee that people
actually will use them.
In this pattern, we shall now discuss the subtler fact that a
south-facing court or garden will still not work, unless there is a
functionally important sunny place within it, intently and specifically
placed for sun, at a central juncture between indoors and
outdoors and immediately next to the indoor rooms which it
serves.
We have some evidence-presented in SOUTH-FACING OUTDOORS
(Io  )-that a deep band of shade between a building and
a sunny area can act as a barrier and keep the area from being
well used. It is this evidence which makes us believe that the most
important sunny places occur up against the exterior walls of
buildings, where people can see into them from inside and step
directly out into the light, leaning in the doorway of the building.
Furthermore, we have observed that these places are more inviting
if they are placed in the crook of a building or wall,
where there is just enough enclosure from a hedge, a low wall,
a column, to provide a backdrop, a place to sit up against and take
in the sun.
I  I SUNNY PLACE
And finally, of course, if the place is really to work, there
must be a good reason for going there: something special which
draws a person there-a swing, a potting table for plants, a special
view, a brick step to sit upon and look into a pool-whatever, so
long as it has the power to bring a person there almost without
thinking about it.
Here is an example-a sunny place at the edge of a building,
directly related to the inside, and set in a nook of the building.
Someone comes there every day to sit for a moment, water the
hanging plants, see how they are doing, and take in some sun.
Sunny place
A particularly beautiful version of this pattern can be made
when several sunny places are placed together-perhaps for a
HOUSE CLUSTER  or a WORK COMMUNITY 1). If the places
can be set down so that they form a south-facing half-necklace of
sunny spots, each within hailing distance of all the others, it
makes the act of coming out into the sun a communal affair.
Therefore:
Inside a south-facing court, or garden, or yard, find the
spot between the building and the outdoors which gets
the best sun. Develop this spot as a special sunny placemake
it the important outdoor room, a place to work in
the sun, or a place for a swing and some special plants, a
place to sunbathe. Be very careful indeed to place the

I  NORTH FACE
... even if the building has been placed correctly according to
SOUTH-FACING OUTDOORS 05 and there is little outdoor space
toward the north, there is usually still some kind of area or
volume on the north face of the building. It is necessary to take
care of this north-facing place to supplement the work of INDOOR
SUNLIGHT  and SUNNY PLACE 1).
Look at the north sides of the buildings which you know.
Almost everywhere you will find that these are the spots
which are dead and dank, gloomy and useless. Yet there are
hundreds of acres in a town on the north sides of buildings;
and it is inevitable that there must always be land in this
position, wherever there are buildings.
If a building has a sheer north face, during many months of
the year it will cast a long shadow out behind it.
North shadows.
These dead and gloomy north sides not only waste enormous
areas of land; they also help to kill the larger environment, by
BUILDINGS
cutting it up with shadow areas which no one wants to cross, and
which therefore break up the various areas of the environment
from one another. It is essential to find a way of making these
north-facing areas alive, at least in their own terms, so that
they help the Lrnd around them instead of breaking it apart.
The shadow cast by the north face is essentially triangular.
To keep this triangle of shade from becoming a forlorn place, it
is necessary to fill it up with things and places which do not need
the sun. For example, the area to the north may form a gentle
cascade which contains the car shelter, perhaps a bath suite, storage,
garbage cans, a studio. If th is cascade is properly made, then
for most of the year the outdoors beyond it to the north will have
enough sun for a garden, a greenhouse, a private garden seat, a
workshop, paths.
North cascade.
Furthermore, if there are north rooms that are inevitably
gloomy, it helps enormously to make a reflecting wall: a wall
standing some ways to the north of the building, painted white
or yellow, and set in a position which gets the sun and reflects
it back into the building. This wall might be the wall of a nearby
building, a garden wall, etc.
Therefore:
Make the north face of the building a cascade which
slopes down to the ground, so that the sun which normally
casts a long shadow to the north strikes the ground immediately
beside the building.

Use the triangle inside this north cascade for car, garbage,
storage, shed, a studio which reguires north light, closets-those
parts of the building which can do very well without interior
sunlight-CAR CONNECTION 13), BULK STORAGE ), COMPOST
(178), CLOSETS BETWEEN ROOMS 8). If it is at all

OUTDOOR ROOM**
... every building has rooms where people stay and live and
talk together-COMMON AREAS AT THE HEART  ), FARMHOUSE
KITCHEN  I ), SEQUENCE OF SITTING SPACES  2). Whenever
possible, these rooms need to be embellished by a further "room"
outdoors. This kind of outdoor room also helps to form a part of
any PUBLIC OUTDOOR ROOM  ), HALF-HIDDEN GARDEN  11),
PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STEET  0) or SUNNY PLACE  I  I).
A garden is the place for lying in the grass, swinging,
croquet, growing flowers, throwing a ball for the dog. But
there is another way of being outdoors: and its needs are
not met by the garden at all.
For some moods, some times of day, some kinds of friendship,
people need a place to eat, to sit in formal clothes, to drink, to
talk together, to be still, and yet outdoors.
They need an outdoor room, a literal outdoor room-a partly
enclosed space, outdoors, but enough like a room so that people

This need occurs everywhere. It is hardly too much to say that
every building needs an outdoor room attached to it, between
it and the garden; and more, that many of the special places in
a garden-sunny places, terraces, gazebos-need to be made as
outdoor rooms, as well.

parties. Indeed, when he talks about the outdoors, he seldom means
his garden. He does not think of gardens as potential living space.
. . . Like the parlor of our grandmothers, the garden is an object
of excessive care. Like the parlor, it is not meant to be lived in. In
an age that puts a premium on usefulness this is most irregular. Paradoxical
though it may sound, the use of glass walls in recent years
alienated the garden. Even the "picture window," as the domestic
version of the show-window is called, hc.s contributed to the estrangement
between indoors and outdoors; the garden has become a
spectator garden.
The historical concept of the house-garden is entirely different.
Domestic gardens as we have known them through the centuries were
valued mostly for their habitableness and privacy, two qualities that
arc conspicuously absent in contemporary gardens. Privacy, so little
in demand these days, was indispensable to people with a taste for
dignified living. The house-gardens of antiquity furnish us, even
in their fragmentary and dilapidated state, perfect examples of how
a diminutive and apparently negligible quantity of land can, with
some ingenuity, be transformed into an oasis of delight. Miniature
gardens though they were, they had all the ingredients of a happy
environment.
These gardens were an essential part of the house; they were,
mind you, contained wit!tin the house. One can best describe them as
rooms without ceilings. They were true outdoor living rooms,
and invariably regarded as such by their inhabitants. The wall- and
floor-materials of Roman gardens, for example, were no less
lavish than those used in the interior part of the house. The combined
use of stone mosaic, marble slabs, stucco reliefs, murnl decorations
from the simplest geometric patterns to the most elaborate murals
established a mood particularly favorable to spiritual composure. As
for the ceiling, there was always the sky in its hundred moods.
(pp.  -59)
An outdoor space becomes a special outdoor room when it is
well enclosed with walls of the building, walls of foliage, columns,
trellis, and sky; and when the outdoor room, together
with an indoor space, forms a virtually continuous living area.
Here are several examples of outdoor rooms. Each one uses a
different combination of eleme:1ts to establish its enclosure; each
one is related to its building in a slightly different way. Rudofsky
gives many other examples in the book we have cited. For
instance, he describes how a front lawn can be rebuilt to become
an outdoor room.
... every building has rooms where people stay and live and
talk together-COMMON AREAS AT THE HEART  ) FARMHOUSE
KITCHEN ), SEQUENCE OF SITTING SPACES 2). Whenever
possible, these rooms need to be embellished by a further "room"
outdoors. This kind of outdoor room also helps to form a part of
any PUBLIC OUTDOOR ROOM ), HALF-HIDDEN GARDEN  I ),
PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STEET  I 0)' or SUNNY PLACE  I 1).
A garden is the place for lying in the grass, swinging,
croquet, growing flowers, throwing a ball for the dog. But
there is another way of being outdoors: and its needs are
not met by the garden at all.
For some moods, some times of day, some kinds of friendsnip,
people need a place to eat, to sit in formal clotnes, to drink, to
talk together, to be still, and yet outdoors.
They need an outdoor room, a literal outdoor room-a partly
enclosed space, outdoors, but enough like a room so that people
behave there as they do in rooms, but with the added beauties of
the sun, and wind, and smells, and rustling leaves, and crickets.
This need occurs everywhere. It is hardly too much to say that
every building needs an outdoor room attached to it, between
it and the garden; and more, that many of the special places m
a garden-sunny places, terraces, gazebos-need to be made as

... wherever there are GREEN STREETS   r), SMALL PUBLIC

(  )-in short, any streets with people in them, these
streets will only come to life if they are helped to do so by the
people looking out on them, hanging out of windows, laughing,
shouting, whistling.

A street without windows is blind and frightening. And
it is equally uncomfortable to be in a house which bounds a
public street with no window at all on the street.
The street window provides a unique kind of connection between
the life inside buildings and the street. Franz Kafka wrote
a short commentary entitled "The Street Window," which expresses
beautifully the power of this relationship.
Whoever leads a solitary life and yet now and then wants to
attach himself somewhere, whoever, according to changes in the
time of day, the weather, the state of his business, and the like,
suddenly wishes to see any arm at all to which he might cling-he
will not be able to manage for long without a window looking
onto the street. And if he is in the mood of not desiring anything and
only goes to his window sill a tired man, with eyes turning from
his public to heaven and back again, not wanting to look out and
having thrown his head up a little, even then the horses below wi!l
draw him down into their train of wagons and tumult, and so at last
into the human harmony. Franz Kafka, The Complete Stories, ed.
Nahum N. Glatzer, New York: Schocken Books, 72, p. 4).
The process of watching the street from upper story windows
is strongly embedded in traditional Peruvian culture in the form
of the mirador, the beautiful ornamented gallery which sticks
out over the street from many of the colonial buildings in Lima.
Peruvian girls especially love to watch the street, but only if they
are not too visible. They can watch the street from the mirador
without any impropriety, something they cannot do so easily
from the front door. If anyone looks at them too hard, they can
pull back into the window.

I  STREET WINDOWS
T!te mirador-tlte lookout.
Street windows are most successful on the second and third
floors. Anything higher, and the street becomes a "view"-the
vitality of the connection is destroyed. From the second and
third floors people can shout down to the street, throw down a
jacket or a ball; people in the street can whistle for a person to
come to the window, and even glimpse the expressions on a person's
face inside.
At ground level, street windows are less likely to work. If they
are too far back from the street, they don't really give a view
onto the street-though of course they still give light. If they are
too close to the street, they don't work at all, because they get
boarded up or curtained to protect the privacy of the rooms inside
-see the empirical findings presented in Houses Generated by
Patterns, Center for Environmental Structure, I 69, pp. I -80.
One possible way of making a street window at ground level
might be to build an alcove, two or three steps up, with a window
on the street, its window-sill five feet above the street. People
in the alcove, can lean on the window sill, and watch the street;
people in the street can see them, without being able to see into
the room behind them. It is even easier, of course, if the

BUILDINGS
ground floor of the house is two or three feet above the street, as
many ground floors are.
Finally, on whatever floor it is, a street window must be placed
in a position which the people inside pass often, a place where
they are likely to pause and stand beside the window: the head
of a stair, the bay window of a favorite room, a kitchen, bedroom,
or window in a passage.
Therefore:
Where buildings run alongside busy streets, build windows
with window seats, looking out onto the street. Place
them in bedrooms or at some point on a passage or stair,
where people keep passing by. On the first floor, keep these
windows high enough to be private.

On the inside, give each of these windows a substantial place,
so that a person feels encouraged to sit there or stand and watch
the street-WINDOW PLACE 0); make the windows open outward-

I   OPENING TO THE STREET*

... many places in a town depend for their success on complete
exposure to the people passing by-far more exposure than a
STREET WINDOW 4 can provide. UNIVERSITY AS A MARKETPLACE
(43), LOCAL TOWN HALL 4), NECKLACE OF COMMUNITY
PROJECTS   ), MARKET OF MANY SHOPS  ), HEAL TH CENTER
(47), STREET CAFE 8), BUILDING THOROUGHFARE 01 are
all examples. This pattern defines the form of the exposure.
The sight of action is an incentive for action. When
people can see into spaces from the street their world is
enlarged and made richer, there is more understanding;
and there is the possibility for communication, learning.
The service center is a storefront, with the windows all along the
front. A man walks past the door. As he does so, he looks into the
center, but only turns his head for a second-apparently unwilling
to show too great a curiosity. He then sees a notice on the window,
stops to read the notice. As he stands reading it, he looks past the
notice to see what is going on inside. After a few seconds he retraces
his steps, and comes into the center.
W!ticft Generates Multi-Ser'Vice Centers, C.E.S., 68, p. 1.)
There are many ways of establishing connection with the street.
I. First, the obvious case: the wall along the street is made
essentially of glass, and the view in is of some inviting activity. A
community center in Berkeley moved from a rennovated house
which was away from the street, to a rennovated furniture showroom
which was completely transparent to the street. The number
of people dropping in soared after the move. It was partly because
the new location was on a much busier pedestrian street, But
transparency also played a role in bringing people in: of the
people walking past the center about  per cent turned and
looked in, and about  per cent stopped-either to read a notice
or to look into the interior more carefully.
 However, a glass connection creates relatively passive involvement.
By comparison, a wall which is actually open-with a
sliding wall or shutter-creates a far more valuable and involving

 OPENING TO THE STREET
connection. When the wall is open it is possible to hear what is
going on inside, to smell the inside, to exchange words, and
even to step in all along the opening. Street cafes, open food
stalls, workshops with garage door openings are examples.
We passed the workshop every day on our way home from school.
It was a furniture shop, and we would stand at the opening and
watch men building chairs and tables, sawdust flying, forming legs
on the lathe. There was a low wall, and the foreman told us to
stay outside it; but he let us sit there, and we did, sometimes for
hours.
 The most involving case of all: act1v1ty is not only open to
sight and sound on one side of the path, but some part of the
activity actually crosses the path, so that people who walk down
the sidewalk find themselves walking through the activity. The
extreme version is the one where a shop is set up to straddle the
path, with goods displayed on either side. A more modest version
is the one where the roof of the space covers the path, the wall
is entirely open, and the paving of the path is continuous with
the "interior" of the space.
No matter how the opening is formed, it is essential that it
expose the ordinary activity inside in a way that invites people
passing to take it in and have some relationship, however modest,
to it. The doctors of the Pioneer Health Center in Peckham
believed this principle to be so essential that they deliberately
built the center's gymnasium, swimming pool, dance floor, cafeteria,
and theater in such a way that people passing could not
help but see others, often people they knew, inside:
... dancing goes on there and moving figures can be seen on the
floor of the main building at night when the whole building is lit
up attracting the attention of the passers by ....
. . . it must be remembered that it is not the action of the skilled
alone that is to be seen in the Centre, but every degree of proficiency
in all that is going on. This point is crucial to an understanding of
how vision can work as a stimulus engendering action in the company
gathering there. In ordinary life the spectator of any activity
is apt to be presented only with the exhibition of the specialist; and
this trend has been gathering impetus year by year with alarming
progression. Audiences swell in their thousands to watch the expert
game, but as the "stars" grow in brilliance, the conviction of an in-

BUILDINGS
eptitude that makes trying not worth while, increasingly confirms the
inactivity of the crowd. It is not then all forms of action that invite
the attempt to action: it is the sight of action that is within the possible
scope of the sp ctator that affords a temptation eventually irresistible
to him. Short though the time of our experiment has been,
this fact has been amply substantiated, as the growth of activities in
the Centre demonstrates.  T J,e Peckham Experiment, I. Pearse and
L. Crocker, New Haven: Yale University Press, 47, pp. -72.)
Therefore:
In any public space which depends for its success on its
exposure to the street, open it up, with a fully opening wall
which can be thrown wide open, and if it is possible, include
some part of the activity on the far side of the pedestrian
path, so that it actually straddles the path, and people
walk through it as they walk along the path.
There are dozens of ways to build such an opening. For
example, a wall can be made very cheaply with a simple
plywood hanging shutter sliding on an overhead rail,
which can be removed to open up completely, and locked
in place at night.

we continue to fill out the BUILDING EDGE 0). Assume
that arcades have been built wherever they make sense-ARCADES
( 19); there are still large areas within the building edge where
BUILDING EDGE tells you to make something positive-but so
far no patterns have explained how this can be done physically.
This pattern shows you how you can complete the edge. It
complements ROOF GARDEN 18 and ARCADES 19 and helps
to enliven the PEDESTRIAN STREET  I 00).
If people cannot walk out from the building onto balconies
and terraces which look toward the outdoor space
around the building, then neither they themselves nor the
people outside have any medium which helps them feel
the building and the larger public world are intertwined.
We have discussed the importance of the building edge in
two other patterns: BUILDING EDGE  0 itself, and ARCADES
( I ). In both cases, we explained how the arcades and the
edge help to create space which people who are outside the
building can use to help them feel more intimately connected
with the building. These patterns, in short, look at the problem
of connection from the point of view of the people outside the
building.
In this pattern we discuss the same problem-but from the
point of view of the people inside the building. We believe,
simply, that every building needs at least one place, and preferably
a whole range of places, where people can be still within
the building, but in touch with the people and the scene outside.
This problem has also been discussed in PRIVATE TERRACE ON
THE STREET 0). But that pattern deals only with one very
important and highly specific occurrence of this need. The
present pattern suggests that the need is completely general: very
plainly, it is fundamental, an all-embracing necessity which
applies to all buildings over and again.
I  GALLERY SURROUND
The need has been documented extensively. See, for example,
Anthony Wallace, Housing and Social Structure, Philadelphia
Housing Authority, 52; Federal Housing Authority, The Livability
Problem of , Families, Washington, D. C., 45.)
Windows on the street, while they have their own virtues, are
simply not enough to satisfy this need. They usually occupy a
very small part of the wall, and can only be used if a person
stands at the edge of the room. The kinds of situations that are
needed are far more rich and engrossing. We need places along
the upper stories of the building's edge where we can live comfortably,
for hours, in touch with the street-playing cards,
bringing work out on the terrace on a hot day, eating, scrambling
with children or setting up an electric train, drying and folding
the wash, sculpting with clay, paying the bills.
In short, almost all the basic human situations can be enriched
by the gualities of the gallery surround. This is why we specify
that each building should have as many versions of it as possible
along its edge-porches, arcades, balconies, awnings, terraces,
and galleries.
Four examples of this pattern.

BUILDINGS
Therefore:
Whenever possible, and at every story, build porches,
galleries, arcades, balconies, niches, outdoor seats, awnings,
trellised rooms, and the like at the edges of buildingsespecially
where they open off public spaces and streets,
and connect them by doors, directly to the rooms inside.

A warning: take care that such places are not stuck artificially
onto the building. Keep them real; find the places along the
building edge that offer a direct and useful connection with the
life indoors-the space outside the stair landing, the space to one
side of the bedroom alcove, and so on.
These places should be an integral part of the building territory,
and contain seats, tables, furniture, places to stand and talk,
places to work outside-all in the public view-PRIVATE TERRACE
ON THE STREET 0), OUTDOOR ROOM 3); make the spaces
deep enough to be really useful-s1x-FOOT BALCONY   )-with
columns heavy enough to provide at least partial enclosure-HALFOPEN
WALL 3), COLUMN PLACES 26). , . ,
I  SIX-FOOT BALCONY**
m various places ARCADES  r r  and GALLERY SURROUND
( I 6 have helped you to imagine some kind of a balcony,
veranda, terrace, porch, arcade along the building edge or halfway
into it. This pattern simply specifies the depth of this arcade
or porch or balcony, to make sure that it really works.

Balconies and porches which are less than six feet deep
are hardly ever used.
Balconies and porches are often made very small to save
money; but when they are too small, they might just as weJl not
be there.
A balcony is first used properly when there is enough room for
two or three people to sit in a small group with room to stretch
their legs, and room for a small table where they can set down
glasses, cups, and the newspaper. No balcony works if it is so
narrow that people have to sit in a row facing outward. The
critical size is hard to determine, but it is at least six feet. The
following drawing and photograph show roughly why:
Six feet deep.
I  SIX-FOOT BALCONY
Our observations make it clear that the difference between
deep balconies and those which are not deep enough is simply
astonishing. In our experience, almost no balconies at all which
are  or  feet deep manage to gather life to them or to get used.
And almost no balconies which are more than six feet deep are
not used.
Narrow balconies are useless.
Two other features of the balcony make a difference in the
degree to which people will use it: its enclosure and its recession
into the building.
As far as enclosure goes, we have noticed that among the
deeper balconies, it is those with half-open enclosures around
them-columns, wooden slats, rose-covered trellises-which are
used most. Apparently, the partial privacy given by a half-open
screen makes people more comfortable-see HALF-OPEN WALL
(193).
And recesses seem to have a similar effect. On a cantilevered
balcony people must sit outside the mass of the building; the
balcony lacks privacy and tends to feel unsafe. In an English study
("Private Balconies in Flats and Maisonettes," Architect's Journal,
March 57, pp. 2-76), two-thirds of the people that
never used their balconies gave lack of privacy as their reason,
Lr Not this ... ... this.
BUILDINGS
and said that they preferred recessed balconies, because, in contrast
to cantilevered balconies, the recesses seemed more secure.
Therefore:
Whenever you build a balcony, a porch, a gallery, or a
terrace always make it at least six feet deep. If possible,
recess at least a part of it into the building so that it is not
cantilevered out and separated from the building by a
simple line, and enclose it partially.

I  CONNECTION TO
THE EARTH**
... this pattern helps to create the BUILDING EDGE  I 0 and
its ARCADES 19), PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET 0),
the GALLERY SURROUND  6), and SIX-FOOT BALCONY  ),
by specifying the way the floor of the building reaches out into
the land and gardens round about it.

A house feels isolated from the nature around it, unless
its floors are interleaved directly with the earth that is
around the house.
We shall understand this best by contrasting those houses which
are sharply separated from the earth with those in which there is a
continuity between the two.
Look first at this house where there is no continuity.
An a·verage house-but look at it closely.
It lacks this pattern utterly.
The inside and the outside are abruptly separate. There is no way
of being partly inside, yet still connected to the outside; there is
no way in which the inside of the house allows you, in your bare
feet, to step out and feel the dew collecting or pick blossoms off
a climbing plant because there is no surface near the house on
which you can go out and yet still be the person that you are
inside.
Compare it with the house in our main picture, where there is
I  CONNECTION TO THE EARTH
continuity. Here, there is an intermediate area, whose surface is
connected to the inside of the house-and yet it is in plain
outdoors. This surface is part of the earth-and yet a little
smoother, a little more beaten, more swept----stepping out on it is
not like stepping out into a field in your bare feet-it is as if the
earth itself becomes in that small area a part of your indoor
terrain.
When we compare the examples, there seems little doubt that
some deep feeling is involved, and we are confident in presenting
this pattern as a fundamental one. But we can only speculate about
its origins or why it is important.
Perhaps the likeliest of all the explanations we are able to
imagine is one which connects the earth bounciness and rootedness
of a man or a woman to their physical connection to the earth.
It is very plain, and we all discover for ourselves, that our lives
become satisfactory to the extent that we are rooted, "down to
earth," in touch with common sense about everyday things-not
flying high in the sky of concepts and fantasies. The path toward
this rootedness is personal and slow-but it may just be true that
it is helped or hindered by the extent to which our physical world
is itself rooted and connected to the earth.
In physical terms, the rootedness occurs in buildings when the
building is surrounded, along at least a part of its perimeter, by
terraces, paths, steps, gravel, and earthen surfaces, which bring
the floors outside, into the land. These surfaces are made of
intermediate materials more natural than the floors inside the
house-and more man-made than earth and clay and grass. Brick
terraces, tiles, and beaten earth tied into the foundations of the
house all help make this connection; and, if possible, each house
should have a reasonable amount of them, pushing out into the
land around the house and opening up the outdoors to the inside.
Therefore:
Connect the building to the earth around it by building
a series of paths and terraces and steps around the edge.
Place them deliberately to make the boundary ambiguousso
that it is impossible to say exactly where the building
stops and earth begins.

... this pattern helps to complete SITE REPAIR  rn4). Where
there are buildings, it ties into the BUILDING EDGE  0 and
can help form it; and it helps create the CONNECTION To THE
EARTH ). If the ground is sloping at all, this pattern tells
you how to handle the slope of the ground in a way that makes
sense for the people in the building, and for the plants and
grasses on the ground.

On sloping land, erosion caused by run off can kill the
soil. It also creates uneven distribution of rainwater over
the land, which naturally does less for plant life than it
could if it were evenly distributed.
Terraces and bunds, built along contour lines, have been used
for thousands of years to solve this problem. Erosion starts when
the water runs down certain lines, erodes the earth along these
Jines, m;ikes it hard for plants to grow there, then forms rills in
the mud and dust, which are then still more vulnerable to more
runoff, and get progressively worse and worse. The terraces control
erosion by slowing down the water, and preventing the
formation of these ril1s in the first place.
Even more important, the terraces spread the water evenly
over the entire landscape. In a given area, each square meter of
earth gets the s .. me amount of water since the water stays where
it falls. Under these conditions, plants can grow everywhereon
the steepest parts of hillsides as easily as in the most luscious
valleys.
The pattern of terracing makes as much sense on a small house
lot as it does on the hills around a valley. Proper terracing on a
small lot creates a stable micro-system of drainage, and protects
the top soil for the local gardens. Our main photograph shows a
small building that is built on a terraced site. Once the terracing
has been accomplished, the building can fit to it, and stretch across
the lines of the terrace.
At both scales-the house lot and the hills-this method of

BUILDINGS
conserving the land and making it healthy is ancient. "Only very
lately has modern anti-erosion practice, for example, through
contour ploughing, managed to match the effectiveness of traditional
methods of terracing long practiced in countries as far apart
as Japan and Peru." M. Nicholson, The Environmental Revolution,
New York: McGraw Hill, 70, p. )
At the scale of hillsides and valleys, China is making an impressive
attempt to reclaim her eroded land in this way. For instance,
Joseph Alsop, "Terraced Fields in China":
In the Chinese countryside, no effort has ever been spared to get a
maximum crop with the resources available. Even so, I was hardly
prepared for the "terrace fields" that they took me to see in the
farming communes around Chungking.
The countryside hereabouts is both rocky and largely composed of
such steep hills that even Chinese would not think of trying to grow
rice on them. The old way, ruinously eroding, was to grow as much
rice as possible in the valleys: and then plant the hillsides, too, where
soil remained.
The new way is to make "terrace fields." The rocks are dynamited
to get the needed building materials. Heavy dry-stone walls are then
built to heights of six or seven feet, following the contours of the
land. And earth is finally brought to fill in behind the stone walls,
thereby producing a terrace field.
Therefore:
On all land which slopes-in fields, in parks, in public
gardens, even in the private gardens around a house-make
a system of terraces and bunds which follow the contour
lines. Make them by building low walls along the contour
lines, and then backfilling them with earth to form
the terraces.
There is no reason why the building itself should fit into
the terraces-it can comfortably cross terrace lines.

autumn, and a marvelous place to walk because it smells so
wonderful, is the orchard.
In the climates where fruit trees grow, the orchards give
the land an almost magical identity: think of the orange
groves of Southern California, the cherry trees of Japan,
the olive trees of Greece. But the growth of cities seems
always to destroy these trees and the quality they possess.
The fact that the trees are seasonal and bear fruit has special
consequences. The presence of orchards adds an experience that
has all but vanished from cities-the experience of growth,
harvest, local sources of fresh food; walking down a city street,
pulling an apple out of a tree, and biting into it.
Fruit trees on common land add much more to the neighborhood
and the community than the same trees in private backyards:
privately grown, the trees tend to produce more fruit than one
household can consume. On public land, the trees concentrate
the feeling of mutual benefit and responsibility. And because they
reguire yearly care, pruning, and harvesting, the fruit trees
naturally involve people in their common land. It is an obvious
place where people can take responsibility for their local common
land, have pride in the results, employ themselves and their
children part time.
Imagine a community gradually being able to produce a portion
of its own need for fruit, or cider, or preserves. In the beginning
it would be a small portion indeed, but it would serve
as a beginning. There is not much work involved if it is tackled
communally, and the satisfaction is great.

BUILDINGS
Therefore:
Plant small orchards of fruit trees in gardens and on
common land along paths and streets, in parks, in neighborhoods:
wherever there are well-established groups that
can themselves care for the trees and harvest the fruit.

. . . trees are precious. Keep them. Leave them in tact. If you
have followed SITE REPAlR  04), you have already taken care to
leave the trees intact and undisturbed by new construction; you
may have planted FRUIT TREES  I 0 ; and you may perhaps
also have other additional trees in mind. This pattern reemphasizes
the importance of leaving trees intact, and shows
you how to plant them, and care for them, and use them, in
such a way that the spaces which they form are useful as extensions
of the building.
When trees are planted or pruned without regard for the
special places they can create, they are as good as dead for
the people who need them.
Trees have a very deep and crucial meaning to human beings.
The significance of old trees is archetypal; in our dreams very
often they stand for the wholeness of personality: "Since ...
psychic growth cannot be brought about by a conscious effort of
will power, but happens involuntarily and naturally, it is in
dreams frequently symbolized by the tree, whose slow, powerful
involuntary growth fulfills a definite pattern." M. L. van Franz,
"The process of individuation," in C. G. Jung, Man and his
Symbols, New York: Doubleday, 64, pp. 1, 3-64.)
There is even indication that trees, along with houses and
other people, constitute one of the three most basic parts of
the human environment. The House-Tree-Person Technique,
developed by Psychologist John Buck, takes the drawings a person
makes of each of these three "wholes" as a basis for projective
tests. The mere fact that trees are considered as full of
meaning, as houses and people, is, alone, a very powerful indication
of their importance V. J. Bicliauskas, The H-T-P Research
Review,  Edition, Western Psychological Services, Los
Angeles, California, 65; and Isaac Jolles, Catalog for the
Qualitative Interpretation of the House-Tree-Person, Los Angeles,
California: Western Psychological Services, 64, pp. 5-97).
I7I TREE PLACES
But for the most part, the trees that are being planted and
transplanted in cities and suburbs today do not satisfy people's
craving for trees. They will never come to provide a sense of
beauty and peace, because they are being set down and built
around without regard for the places they create.
The trees that people love create special social places: places to
be in, and pass through, places you can dream about, and places
you can draw. Trees have the potential to create various kinds of
social places: an umbrella-where a single, low-sprawling tree
like an oak defines an outdoor room; a pair-where two trees
form a gateway; a grove-where several trees cluster together; a
square-where they enclose an open space; and an avenuewhere
a double row of trees, their crowns touching, line a path or
street. It is only when a tree's potential to form places is realized
that the real presence and meaning of the tree is felt.
The trees that are being set down nowadays have nothing of
this character-they are in tubs on parking lots and along streets,
in specially "landscaped areas" that you can see but cannot get
to. They do not form places in any sense of the word-and so
they mean nothing to people.
Now, there is a great danger that a person who has read this
argument so far, may misinterpret it to mean that trees should
be "used" instrumentally for the good of people. And there is,
unfortunately, a strong tendency in cities today to do just that
-to treat trees instrumentally, as means to our own pleasure.
But our argument says just the opposite. Trees in a city, round
a building, in a park, or in a garden are not in the forest. They
need attention. As soon as we decide to have trees in a city, we
must recognize that the tree becomes a different sort of ecological
being. For instance, in a forest, trees grow in positions favorable to
them: their density, sunlight, wind, moisture are all chosen by
the process of selection. But in a city, a tree grows where it is
planted, and it will not survive unless it is most carefully tended
-pruned, watched, cared for when its bark gets pierced ...
But now we come to a very subtle interaction. The trees will
not get tended unless the places where they grow are Ii ked and
used by people. If they are randomly planted in some garden or
in the shrubbery of some park, they arc not near enough to

BUILDINGS
people to make people aware of them; and this in turn makes it
unlikely that they will get the care they need.
So, finally, we see the nature of the complex interactive symbiosis
between trees and people.
I. First, people need trees-for the reasons given.
 But when people plant trees, the trees need care unlike
the forest trees).
 The trees won't get the care they need unless they are in
places people like.
 And this in turn requires that the trees form social spaces.
 Once the trees form social spaces, they are able to grow
naturally.
So we see, by a curious twist of circumstances, trees m c1t1cs
can only grow well, and in a fashion true to their own nature,
when they cooperate with people and help to form spaces which
the people need.
Therefore:
If you are planting trees, plant them according to their
nature, to form enclosures, avenues, squares, groves, and
single spreading trees toward the middle of open spaces.
And shape the nearby buildings in response to trees, so that
the trees themselves, and the trees and buildings togetheF,
form places which people can use.

I  GARDEN GROWING WILD**

, .. with terracing in place and trees taken care of-TERRACED
SLOPE ), FRUIT TREES 0), TREE PLACES 1), we
come to the garden itself-to the ground and plants. In short, we
must decide what kind of garden to have, what kind of plants to
grow, what style of gardening is compatible with both artifice and
nature.

A garden which grows true to its own laws s not a
wilderness, yet not entirely artificial either.
Many gardens are formal and artificial. The flower beds are
trimmed like table cloths or painted designs. The lawns are
clipped like perfect plastic fur. The paths are clean, like new
polished asphalt. The furniture is new and clean, fresh from
the department store.
These gardens have none of the quality which brings a garden
to life-the quality of a wilderness, tamed, still wild, but cultivated
enough to be in harmony with the buildings which surround
it and the people who move in it. This balance of wilderness
and cultivation reached a high point in the oldest English
gardens.
In these gardens things are arranged so that the natural
processes which come into being will maintain the condition of
the garden and not degrade it. For example, mosses and grasses
will grow between paving stones. In a sensible and natural garden,
the garden is arranged so that this process enhances the
garden and does not threaten it. In an unnatural garden these
kinds of small events have constantly to be "looked after"-the
gardener must constantly try to control and eradicate the processes
of seeding, weeds, the spread of roots, the growth of grass.
In the garden growing wild the plants are chosen, and the
boundaries placed, in such a way that the growth of things regulates
itself. It does not need to be regulated by control. But it
does not grow fiercely and undermine the ways in which it is
planted. Natural wild plants, for example, are planted among

 GARDEN GROWING WILD
flowers and grass, so that there is no room for so-called weeds to
fill the empty spaces and then need weeding. Natural stone edges
form the boundaries of grass so that there is no need to chop
the turf and clip the edge every few weeks. Rocks and stones are
placed where there are changes of level. And there are small rock
plants placed between the stones, so that once again there is no
room for weeds to grow.
A garden growing wild is healthier, more capable of stable
growth, than the more clipped and artificial garden. The garden
can be left alone, it will not go to ruin in one or two seasons.
And for the people too, the garden growing wild creates a
more profound experience. The gardener is in the position of a
good doctor, watching nature take its course, occasionally taking
action, pruning, pulJing out some species, only to give the
garden more room to grow and become itself. By contrast, the
gardens that have to be tended obsessively, enslave a person to
them; you cannot learn from them in quite the same way.
Therefore:
Grow grasses, mosses, bushes, flowers, and trees in a
way which comes close to the way that they occur in
nature: intermingled, without barriers between them, without
bare earth, without formal flower beds, and with all
the boundaries and edges made in rough stone and brick
and wood which become a part of the natural growth.
BUILDINGS

Include no formal elements, except where something is specifically
called for by function-like a greenhouse-GREENHOUSE

WATER  1), or flowers placed just where people can touch
them and smell them-RAISED FLOWERS  ....
 GARDEN WALL*

rn private houses, both the HALF-HIDDEN GARDEN III)
and the PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET 0 require walls.
More generally, not only private gardens, but public gardens
too, and even small parks and greens-QUIET BACKS   ), ACCESSIBLE
GREEN  0), need some kind of enclosure round them,
to make them as beautiful and quiet as possible.

Gardens and small public parks don't give enough relief
from noise unless they are well protected.
People need contact with trees and plants and water. In some
way, which is hard to express, people are able to be more whole in
the presence of nature, are able to go deeper into themselves, and
are somehow able to draw sustaining energy from the life of plants
and trees and water.
In a city, gardens and small parks try to solve this problem;
but they are usually so close to traffic, noise, and buildings that
the impact of nature is entirely lost. To be truly useful, in the
deepest psychological sense, they must allow the people in them
to be in touch with nature-and must be shielded from the sight
and sound of passing traffic, city noises, and buildings. This requires
walls, substantial high walls, and dense planting all around
the garden.
In those few cases where there are small walled gardens in a
city, open to the public-Alhambra, Copenhagen Royal Library
Garden-these gardens almost always become famous. People
understand and value the peace which they create .
. . . your garden or park wall of brick ... has indeed often an
unkind look on the outside, but there is more modesty in it than unkindness.
It generally means, not that the builder of it wants to
shut you out from the view of his garden, but from the view of
himself: it is a frank statement that as he needs a certain portion
of time to himself, so he needs a certain portion of ground to
himself, and must not be stared at when he digs there in his shirt-

in it, and shelters you from the east wind, and ripens your
peaches and nectarines, and glows in autumn like a sunny bank.
And, moreover, yom brick wall, if you build it properly, so that
it shall stand long enough, is a beautiful thing when it is old, and
has assumed its grave purple red, touched with mossy green ....
(John Ruskin, T l,e Two Paths, New York: Dutton, 07, pp. 02-
 .)
This pattern applies to :ill private gardens and to small parks
in cities. We are not convinced that it applies to all small parksbut
it is hard to differentiate precisely between the places where
a walled garden is desirable and the places where it is not. There
arc definitely situations where a small park, and perhaps even a
small garden that is open to the rush of life around it, is just
right. However, there are far more parks and gardens left open,
that need to be walled, than vice versa, so we emphasize the
walled condition.
Therefore:
Form some kind of enclosure to protect the interior of
a quiet garden from the sights and sounds of passing
traffic. If it is a large garden or a park, the enclosure can
BUILDINGS
be soft, can include bushes, trees, slopes, and so on. The
smaller the garden, however, the harder and more definite
the enclosure must become. In a very small garden, form
the enclosure with buildings or walls; even hedges and
fences will not be enough to keep out sound.

a path-PATHS AND GOALS  I  )-or, even more important,
where the edges between two parts of a garden need to be
marked without making a wall, an open trellised walk which can
enclose space, is required. Above all, these trellised walks help to
form the POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACES  ro6 in a garden or a park;
and may perhaps help to form an ENTRANCE TRANSITION II ).

Trellised walks have their own special beauty. They are
so unique, so different from other ways of shaping a path,
that they are almost archetypal.
In PATH SHAPE  I  I), we have described the need for outdoor
paths to have a shape, like rooms. In POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE
( I 06), we have explained the need for larger outdoor areas to
have positive shape. A trellised walk does both. It makes it possible
to implement both these patterns at the same time-simply
and elegantly. But it does it in such a fundamental way that we
have decided to treat it as a separate pattern; and we shall try
to define the places where a trellised structure over a path is
appropriate.
 Use it to emphasize the path it covers, and to set off one
part of the path as a special section of a longer path in order to
make it an especially nice and inviting place to walk.
A trellis gives shape to an outdoor area.

I  TRELLISED WALK
 Since the trellised path creates enclosure around the spaces
which it bounds, use it to create a virtual wall to define an outdoor
space. For example, a trellised walk can form an enormous
outdoor room by surrounding, or partially surrounding, a garden.
Therefore:
Where paths need special protection or where they need
some intimacy, build a trellis over the path and plant it
with climbing Rowers. Use the trellis to help shape the
outdoor spaces on either side of it.

Think about the columns that support the trellis as themselves
capable of creating places-seats, bird feeders-COLUMN
PLACES 26). Pave the path with loosely set stones-PAVING

... to keep a garden alive, it is almost essential that there be a
"workshop"-a kind of halfway house between the garden and
the house itself, where seedlings grow, and where, in temperate
climates, plants can grow in spite of cold. In a HOUSE CLUSTER
(37 or a WORK COMMUNITY 1), this workshop makes an essential
contribution to the COMMON LAND ).
Many efforts are being made to harness solar energy by
converting it into hot water or electric power. And yet the
easiest way to harness solar energy is the most obvious and
the oldest: namely, to trap the heat inside a greenhouse
and use it for growing flowers and vegetables.
Imagine a simple greenhouse, attached to a living room, turned
to the winter sun, and .filled with shelves for flowers and vegetables.
It has an entrance from the house-so you can go into it
and use it in the winter without going outdoors. And it has an
entrance from the garden-so you can use it as a workshop while
you are out in the garden and not have to walk through the
house.
This greenhouse then becomes a wonderful place: a source of
life, a place where flowers can be grown as part of the life of the
house. The classic conservatory was a natural part of countless
houses in the temperate climates.
For someone who has not experienced a greenhouse as an extension
of the house, it may be hard to recognize how fundamental
it becomes. It is a world unto itself, as definite and wonderful
as fire or water, and it provides an experience which can
hardly be matched by any other pattern. Hewitt Ryan, the
psychiatrist for whom we built the clinic in Modesto with the
help of this pattern language, thought greenhouses so essential
that he included one as a basic part of the clinic: a place beside
the common area, where people could reintegrate themselves by
growing seedlings that would be gradually transplanted to form
gardens for the clinic.

BUILDINGS
Several recent "energy-systems" inspired by the ecology movement
ha\·e sought to make grcenh.onses a fundamental part of
human settlements. For example, Grahame Gaines' self-contained
eco-house includes a large greenhouse as a source of heat and
food. See Lonrlon Observer, October I i2, And Chahroudi's
Grow Hole-a glazed sunken pit for growing vegetables in
winter-is another kind of greenhonse Progressive Architecture,
July I9iO, p. 5).
Therefore:
In temperate climates, build a greenhouse as part of
your house or office, so that it is both a "room" of the
house which can be reached directly without going outdoors
and a part of the garden which can be reached
directly from the garden .

... with the character of the garden fixed-GARDEN GROWING
WILD  I  ), we consider the special corners which make the
garden valuable and somewhat secret. Of these, the most important
is the SUNNY PLACE  I  I), which has already been described,
because it is so fundamental to the building. Now we
add to this another seat, more private, where a person can go to
sit and think and dream.
Somewhere in every garden, there must be at least one
spot, a quiet garden seat, in which a person-or two
people-can reach into themselves and be in touch with
nothing else but nature.
Throughout the patterns in this pattern language we have said,
over and again, how very essential it is to give ourselves environments
in which we can be in touch with the nature we have
sprung from-see especially CITY COUNTRY FINGERS  and
QUIET BACKS ). But among all the various statements of this
fact there is not one so far which puts this need right in our own
houses, as close to us as fire and food.
Wordsworth built his entire politics, as a poet, around the
fact that tranquility in nature was a basic right to which everyone
was entitled. He wanted to integrate the need for solitudein-
nature with city living. He imagined people literally stepping
off busy streets and renewing themselves in private gardensevery
day. And now many of us have come to learn that without
such a place life in a city is impossible. There is so much activ:ty,
days are so easily filled with jobs, family, friends, things to dothat
time alone is rare. And the more we live without the habit of
stillness, the more we tie ourselves to this active life, the stranger
and more disquieting the experience of stillness and solitude
becomes: city people are notoriously busy-busy, and cannot be
alone, without "input," for a moment.
It is in this context that we propose the isolated garden seat:
a place hidden in the garden where one or two people can sit
alone, undisturbed, near growing things. It may be on a roof
 GARDEN SEAT
top, on the ground, perhaps even half-sunken in an embankment.
There are literally hundreds of old books about gardens which
testify to this pattern. One is Hildegarde Hawthorne's The Lure
of the Garden, New York: The Century Co.,  I. We quote
from a passage describing the special kind of small talk that is
drawn out of people by quiet garden seats:
Perhaps, of all the various forms of gossip overheard by the
garden, the loveliest is that between a young and an old person who
are friends. Real friendship between the generations is rare, but
when it exists it is of the finest. That youth is fortunate who can
pour his perplexities into the ear of an older man or woman, and
who knows a comradeship and an understanding exceeding in beauty
the facile friendships created by like interests and common pursuits;
and fortunate too the girl who is able to impart the emotions
and ideas aroused in her by her early meetings with the world and
life to some one old in experience but comprehendingly young in
heart. Both of them will remember those hours long after the garden
gate has closed behind their friend forever; as long, indeed, as they
remember anything that went to the making of the best in them.
Therefore:
Make a quiet place in the garden-a private enclosure
with a comfortable seat, thick planting, sun. Pick the place
for the seat carefully; pick the place that will give you the
most intense kind of solitude.

... we have one pattern, already, which brings out the useful
character of gardens-both public and private ones-FRUIT TREES
(170); we supplement this with a smaller, but as important
aspect of the garden-one which every public and private
garden should contain: enhance common land-coMMON LAND
(67 and private gardens-HALF-HIDDEN GARDEN  l  with a
patch where people can grow vegetables.

In a healthy town every family can grow vegetables for
itself. The time is past to think of this as a hobby for enthusiasts;
it is a fundamental part of human life.
Vegetables are the most basic foods. If we compare dairy
products, vegetables and fruits, meats, and synthetic foods, the
vegetables play the most essential role. As a class, they are the
only ones which are by themselves wholly able to support human
life. And, in an ecologically balanced world, it seems almost
certain that man will have to work out some balanced relationship
with vegetables for his daily food. See, for example, F. Lappe,
Diet for a Small Planet, New York: Ballantine,  .)
Since the industrial revolution, there has been a growing tendency
for people to rely on impersonal producers for their vegetables;
however, in a world where vegetables are central and
where self-sufficiency increases, it becomes as natural for families
to have their own vegetables as their own air.
The amount of land it takes to grow the vegetables for a
household is surprisingly small. It takes about one-tenth of an
acre to grow an adequate year round supply of vegetables for a
family of four. And apparently vegetables give a higher "nutrient
return" for fixed quantities of energy-sun, labor-than
any other food. This means that every house or house cluster
can create its own supply of vegetables, and that every household
which does not have its own private land attached to it should
have a portion of a common vegetable garden close at hand.
Beside this fundamental need for vegetable gardens in cities,
BUILDINGS
there is a subtler need. Parks, street trees, and manicured lawns
do very little to establish the connection between us and the
land. They teach us nothing of its productivity, nothing of its
capacities. Many people who are born, raised, and live out their
lives in cities simply do not know where the food they eat comes
from or what a living garden is like. Their only connection with
the productivity of the land comes from packaged tomatoes on
the supermarket shelf. But contact with the land and its growing
process is not simply a guaint nicety from the past that we can
let go of casually. More likely, it is a basic part of the process
of organic security. Deep down, there must be some sense of insecurity
in city dwellers who depend entirely upon the supermarkets
for their produce.
Community gardens needn't be expensive propositions either. When
Santa Barbara residents decided to start a downtown garden back in
May, 70, they used their ingenuity. A vacant downtown lot was
acquired at a cost of one dollar for  months), and the city provided
free water and a tractor with operator for two days. Compost
was no problem. The group got leaves from the park department,
hard sludge from the local sanitation district, and horse manure
from a nearby riding club. Tools and seeds were donated. "Community
Gardens," Bob Roda le, San Francisco Chronicle, May  ,
1972, p. .)
School garden in Amsterdam, worked by the children.
Therefore:
Set aside one piece of land either in the private garden or
on common land as a vegetable garden. About one-tenth of

an acre is needed for each family of four. Make sure the
vegetable garden is in a sunny place and central to all the
households it serves. Fence it in and build a small storage

... the garden is a valuable part of the house, because it can
help you grow fruit and vegetables-FRUIT TREES  r 0), VEGETABLE

and this nourishment, in the form of compost, can only
be created when the garbage and the wastes from the individual
houses and HOUSE CLUSTERS  and from the ANIMALS 4 are
properly organi2.ed.

Our current ways of getting rid of sewage poison the
great bodies of natural water, and rob the land around
our buildings of the nutrients they need.
To the average individual in the city, it probably appears that
the sewage system works beautifully-no muss, no fuss. Just pull
the toilet chain, and everything is fine. In fact, city dwellers who
have had the experience of using a smelly outhouse would probably
argue that our modern system of sewage disposal is a tremendous
advance over earlier practices. Unfortunately, this is
simply not the case. Almost every step in modern sewage disposal
is either wasteful, expensive, or dangerous.
We can start by remembering that every single time a toilet is
flushed, seven gallons of drinking water go down the drain. In
fact, around half of our domestic water consumption goes to
flushing out the toilet.
Beyond the cost of the water, there is an enormous cost in
the hardware of the sewer system. The average new homeowner
today, living on a  x I  foot lot in the city, has paid
$ I  oo as his share of the collection system which takes sewage
from his house to the sewage treatment plant. In lower density
residential areas, this cost may be $ or even $6000. Each
house pays an additional $  toward the cost of the sewage
treatment plant. We see then that the initial cost of today's
sewage system is at least $  per house, often more. And these
prices do not include monthly service charges for water and sewer
facilities: around $  per year for a single family household.
BUILDINGS
In addition we must add those costs which are less easily
measurable in dollars and cents, but which may, in the long
run, prove even higher than those already discussed. These include:
(I the value of lost nutrients which are allowed to fl.ow
away into the rivers and oceans-nutrients which could have
been used to build up the soil they came from; and   the
cost of the pollution: effluents cause "eutrophication"-the
sewage depletes the oxygen in water and causes it to become
clogged with algae.
What can be done/ Some of this effluent might be recycled
back to the land in the form of sludge. But residential sewage is
usually mixed with industrial waste which often contains extremely
noxious elements. And even if industrial wastes were not
allowed into the sewage system, an additional distribution system
would be needed to get the sludge back to the land. We see,
therefore, that additional costs required to make the existing
system ecologically sound are prohibitive.
What is needed is not a larger, more centralized and complex
system, but a smaller, more decentralized and simpler one. We
need a system that is less expensive; and we need a system that
is an ecological benefit rather than an ecological drain.
We propose that individual small-scale composting plants begin
to replace our present. disposal system. Small buildings would be
equipped with their own miniature sewage plants, located directly
under the toilets. All bulky garbage produced on-site would
be added to the plants. The resultant humus would be used to
replenish the soil surrounding the building and throughout the
neighborhood, as would the waste water from bathing and
washing.
Such miniature sewage plants are commercially available and

 COMPOST
Clivus compost chamber.
These composting plants are so simple that they can be built
by amateurs for much less money. An extremely simple homemade
composting system is described below:
The privy is built adjoining a larger outbuilding which is built
over a root cellar. From overhead joists to floor, the cellar is
about ' deep. And so it was simplest to make the composting chamber
beneath the privy ' deep ....
In the composting chamber underneath our privy, we have been
using peat-moss-both because it is highly absorbent, and because it
comes compactly baled and is convenient to store. We also use some
garden dirt and a little lime.
We keep a garbage can full of peat moss in the privy, and dump
in about a quart of the moss after each use. The privy is fairly
odorless. Whenever there gets to be a smell I add lime, dirt and ar,
extra layer of peat moss. That takes care of it. I figure that we will
use three or four bales of peat moss a year-for a family of four plus
a large number of guests.
My privy is of the kind familiarly known as a two-holer, which
seems necessary for my composting system.
We use only one hole at a time. We use A until there is an accumulation
 inches deep. We then shift to B and use it until the accumulation
there is as great as that of A. Then the heap at A is
shoveled to C, and so on. When all four positions are filled, C and
D are shoveled into a heap on the ground outside, where I mean to
let it stay for at least several weeks before use.  Organic Gardening

... many large rooms are not complete unless they have smaller
rooms and alcoves opening off them. This pattern, and several

No homogeneous room, of homogeneous height, can
serve a group of people well. To give a group a chance to
be together, as a group, a room must also give them the
chance to be alone, in one's and two's in the same space.
This problem is felt most acutely in the common rooms of a
house-the kitchen, the family room, the living room. In fact, it
is so critical there, that the house can drive the family apart when
it remains unsolved. Therefore, while we believe that the pattern
applies equally to workplaces and shops and schools-in fact, to
all common rooms wherever they are-we shall focus our discussion
on the house, and the use of alcoves around the family
common rooms.
In modern life, the main function of the family is emotional;
it is a source of security and love. But these qualities will only
come into existence if the members of the house are physically
able to be together as a family.
This is often difficult. The various members of the family come
and go at different times of day; even when they are in the
house, each has his own private interests: sewing, reading, homework,
carpentry, model-building, games. In many houses, these
interests force people to go off to their own rooms, away from
the family. Th is happens for two reasons. First, in a normal
family room, one person can easily be disturbed by what the
others are doing: the person who wants to read, is disturbed by
the fact that the others arc watching TV. Second, the family
room does not usually have any space where people can leave
BUILDINGS
things and not have them disturbed. Books left on the dining
table get cleared away at meal times; a half-finished game cannot
be left standing. Naturally, people get into the habit of
doing these things somewhere else-away from the family.
To solve the problem, there must be some way in which the
members of the family can be together, even when they are doing
different things. This means that the family room needs a number
of small spaces where people can do different things. The
spaces need to be far enough away from the main room, so that
any clutter that develops in them does not encroach on the
communal uses of the main room. The spaces need to be connected,
so that people are still "together" when they are in them:
this means they need to be open to each other. At the same time
they need to be secluded, so a person in one of them is not disturbed
by the others. In short, the family room must be surrounded
by small alcoves. The alcoves should be large enough for
one or two people at a time: about six feet wide, and between
three and six feet deep. To make it clear that they arc separate
from the main room, so they do not clutter it up, and so that
people in them are secluded, they should be nHrower than the
family room walls, and. have lower ceilings than the main room.
Family room alcoves.
Since this pattern is so fundamental, we now present several
quotes from various writers to underscore the fact that many
people have made roughly similar observations:
From Psychosocial Interior of tlte Family, Gerald Handel, ed.,
Chicago, Ill.: Aldine Publishing Company, 67, p. .
This fundamental duality of family life is of considerable significance,
for the individual's efforts to take his own kind of interest
I  ALCOVES
in the world, to become his own kind of person, proceed apace with
his efforts to find gratifying connection to the other members. At the
same time, the other members are engaged in taking their kinds of
interest in him, and in themselves. This is the matrix of interaction
in which a family develops its life. The family tries to cast itself in a
form that satisfies the ways in which its members want to be together
and apart ....
From Children in the Family by Florence Powdermaker and
Louise Grimes, New York: Farrar & Reinhart, Inc., 40, p.
108: "Even if a child has a room of his own, he doesn't like
being kept there all day long but wants to spend much of his
time in other parts of the house .... " And p. I I : " ... he
enjoys and craves attention. He likes to show things to adults and
have them share in the pleasure of his discoveries. Besides, he is
entranced by their activities and vvould like to have a finger in
every pie."
And from Svend Riemer, "Sociological Theory of Home Adjustment,"
American Soc. Rev., Vol. , No. , June 43, p. 7:
In adjustment to the activities of other members of the family, it
will be necessary to "migrate" . . . between the different rooms of
the family home. Even the same activity rnay have to be moved from
one room to the other at different times of the day.
Horne studies for example may have to be carried out in the living
room during the afternoon, while food is being prepared in the
kitchen; they may have to be continued in the kitchen during the
evening hours, when the living room is occupied by leisure time
activities of other members of the family. This "migration" between
different rooms is apt to impair intellectual concentration. It may
convey a sense of insecurity. Its possible disadvantages have to be
seriously considered whenever children are reared in the family
home.
It is clear then, that the opposing needs for some seclnsion and
some community at the same time in the same sp.1ce, occur in
almost every family. It is not hard to see that only slightly different
versions of the very same forces exist in all communal
rooms. People want to be together; but at the same time they
want the opportunity for some small amount of privacy, without
giving up community.
lf ten people, or five, are together in a room, and two of them
want to pull away to one side to have a guiet talk together, they
need a place to do it. Only the alcove, or some version of the
BUILDINGS
alcove, can give them the privacy they need, without forcing
them to give the group up altogether.
Therefore:
Make small places at the edge of any common room,
usually no more than  feet wide and  to  feet deep and
possibly much smaller. These alcoves should be large
enough for two people to sit, chat, or play and sometimes
large enough to contain a desk or a table.
Give the alcove a ceiling which is markedly lower than the
ceiling height in the main room-CEILING HEIGHT VARIETY
( I 0 ; make a partial boundary between the alcove and the common
room by using low walls and thick columns-HALF-OPEN

I  WINDOW PLACE**
... this pattern helps complete the arrangement of the windows
given by ENTRANCE ROOM  I 0), ZEN VIEW  ), LIGHT ON
TWO SIDES OF EVERY ROOM ), STREET WINDOWS 4).
According to the pattern, at least one of the windows in each
room needs to be shaped in such a way as to increase its usefulness
as a space.
Everybody loves window seats, bay windows, and big
windows with low sills and comfortable chairs drawn up
to them.
It is easy to think of these kinds of places as luxuries, which
can no longer be built, and which we are no longer lucky
enough to be able to afford.
In fact, the matter is more urgent. These kinds of windows
which create "places" next to them are not simply luxuries; they
are necessary. A room which does not have a place like this seldom
allows you to feel fully comfortable or perfectly at ease.
Indeed, a room without a window place may keep you in a state
of perpetual unresolved conflict and tension--slight, perhaps, but
definite.
This conflict takes the following form. If the room contains no
window which is a "place," a person in the room will be torn
between two forces:
I. He wants to sit down and be comfortable.
 He is drawn toward the light.
Obviously, if the comfortable places-those places in the room
where you most want to sit-are away from the windows, there
is no way of overcoming this conflict. You see, then, that our
love for window "places" is not a luxury but an organic intuition,
based on the natural desire a person has to let the forces he experiences
run free. A room where you feel truly comfortable will
always contain some kind of window place.
Now, of course, it is hard to give an exact definition of a
I  WINDOW PLACE
"place." Essentially a "place" is a partly enclosed, distinctly
identifiable spot within a room. All of the following can function
as "places" in this sense: bay windows, window seats, a low
window sill where there is an obvious position for a comfortable
armchair, and deep alcoves with windows all around them. To
make the concept of a window place more precise, here are some
examples of each of these types, together with discussion of the
critical features which make each one of them work.
A bay window. A shallow bulge at one end of a room, with
windows wrapped around it. It works as a window place because
of the greater intensity of light, the views through the side
windows, and the fact that you can pull chairs or a sofa up into
the bay.
A bay window.
A window seat. More modest. A niche, just deep enough for
the seat. It works best for one person, sitting parallel to the
window, back to the window frame, or for two people facing
each other in this position.
A qvindow seat.

BUILDINGS
A low sill. The most modest of all. The right sill height for a
window place, with a comfortable chair, is very low:  to
inches. The feeling of enclosure comes from the armchairbest
of all, one with a high back and sides.
A low sill.
A glazed alcove. The most elaborate kind of window place:
almost like a gazebo or a conservatory, windows all around it, a
small room, almo,t part of the garden.
A glazed alcove.
And, of course, there are other possible versions too. In principle,
any window with a reasonably pleasant view can be a
window place, provided that it is taken seriously as a space, a
volume, not merely treated as a hole in the wall. Any room
that people use often should have a window place. And window
places should even be considered for waiting rooms or as special
places along the length of hallways.

I  I THE FIRE*
... this pattern helps to create the spirit of the COMMON AREAS
AT THE HEART  I ), and even helps to give its layout and position,
because it influences the way that paths and rooms relate to
one another.

There is no substitute for fire.
Television often gives a focus to a room, but it is nothing but a
feeble substitute for something which is actually alive and flickering
within the room. The need for fire is almost as fundamental
as the need for water. Fire is an emotional touchstone, comparable
to trees, other people, a house, the sky. But the traditional fireplace
is nearly obsolete, and new ones are often added to homes as
"luxury items." Perhaps this explains why these showpiece fireplaces
are always so badly located. Stripped of the logic of necessity,
they seem an afterthought, not truly integrated.
The most convincing statement of the need for fire that we
have found is in Gaston Bachelard's book, The Psychoanalysis of
Fire. Here is a long quote from Bachelard to give you some idea
of the power of his argument.
The fire confined to the fireplace was no doubt for man the first
object of reverie, the symbol of repose, the invitation to repose. One
can hardly conceive of a philosophy of repose that would not include
a reverie before a flaming log fire. Thus, in our opinion, to be
deprived of a reverie before a burning fire is to lose the first use and
the truly human use of fire. To be sure, a fire warms us and gives us
comfort. But one only becomes fully aware of this comforting sensation
after quite a long period of contemplation of the flames; one
only receives comfort from the fire when one leans his elbows on
his knees and holds his head in his hands. This attitude comes from
the distant past. The child by the fire assumes it naturally. Not for
nothing is it the attitude of the Thinker. It leads to a very special
kind of attention which has nothing in common with the attention
involved in watching or observing. Very rarely is it utilized for
any other kind of contemplation. When near the fire, one must be
seated; one must rest without sleeping; one must engage in reverie
on a specific object. ...
BUILDINGS
Of course the supporters of the theory of the utilitarian formation
of the mind will not accept a theory so facile in its idealism, and
they will point out to us the multiple uses of fire in order to ascertain
the exact interest that we have in it: not only does fire give
heat, but it also cooks meats. As if the complex hearth, the peasant's
hearth, precluded reverie I •••
. . . From the notched teeth of the chimney hook there hung the black
cauldron. The three-legged cooking pot projected over the hot
embers. Puffing up her cheeks to blow into the steel tube, my grandmother
would rekindle the sleeping flames. Everything would be
cooking at the same time: the potatoes for the pigs, the choice potatoes
for the family. For me there would be a fresh egg cooking
under the ashes ... on days when I was on my good behavior,
they would bring out the waffle iron. Rectangular in form, it would
crush down the fire of thorns burning red as the spikes of sword
lilies. And soon the gaufre or waffle would be pressed against my
pinafore, warmer to the fingers than to the lips. Yes, then indeed
I was eating fire, eating its gold, its odor and even its crackling
while the burning gaufre was crunching under my teeth ....
And it is always like that, through a kind of extra pleasure-like
dessert-that fire shows itself a friend of man. It does not confine
itself to cooking; it makes things crisp and crunchy. It puts the
golden crust on the griddle cake; it gives a material form to man's
festivities. As far back in time as we can go, the gastronomic value
has always been more highly prized than the nutritive value, and it is
in joy and not in sorrow that man discovered his intellect. The conquest
of the superfluous gives us a greater spiritual excitement than
the conquest of the necessary. Man is a creation of desire, not a
creation of need.
But the reverie by the fireside has axes that are more philosophical.
Fire is for the man who is contemplating it an example of a sudden
change or development and an example of a circumstantial development.
Less monotonous and less abstract than flowing water, even
more quick to grow and to change than the young bird, we watch
every day in its nest in the bushes, fire suggests the desire to change,
to speed up the passage of time, to bring all of life to its conclusion,
to its hereafter. In these circumstances the reverie becomes truly fascinating
and dramatic; it magnifies human destiny; it links the small
to the great, the hearth to the volcano, the life of a log to the life of
a world. The fascinated individual hears the call of the funeral pyre.
For him destruction is more than a change, it is a renewal. ...
Love, death and fire are untied at the same moment. Through its
sacrifice in the heart of the flames, the mayfly gives us a lesson in
eternity. This total death which leaves no trace is the guarantee that
our whole person has departed for the beyond. To lose everything
in order to gain everything. The lesson taught by the fire is
clear: "After having gained all through skill, through love or
 THE FIRE
through violence you must give up all, you must annihilate yourself."
(Gaston Bachelard, The Psychoanalysis of Fire, Boston: Beacon
Press, 64, pp. -16. Originally published as La Psychanalyse du
F eu, Librarie Gallimard,  . Reprinted by permission of Beacon
Press.)
Another, more down-to-earth, view of the need for fire comes
from Mrs. Field, quoted in Robert Woods Kennedy, The House
and the Art of Its Design, New York: Reinhold, 53, pp. 2-
93:
During the winter months, when the children are often confined
indoors for their play, it often happens that around four a-clock
or a little after they become cross and grumpy in their playroom,
or wild and almost hysterical with boredom. Then I light a fire in
the living-room fireplace, and send the children in there to watch it;
if the fire were not lighted they would continue their quarreling and
perhaps try to turn the quiet room into another bedlam, but with
the burning flames on the hearth, they relax into easy interest.
They see things in the fire, someone tells a story that interests the
whole group, they quiet down, leaving me free to prepare the
supper and serve it. It has a definitely hypnotic quality that can be
turned to good account.
Of course, we must face the fact that in many parts of the world
wood and coal fires are ecologically unsound. They pollute the
air; they are inefficient for heating; they are a drain on wood
reserves. If we wish to maintain the habit of burning fires in the
home, we shall have to find a way of supplementing wood fuel.
For example, we can cultivate the habit of burning the inflammable
materials that become waste around the house and
throughout the community-paper, cloth, non-chlorinated plastics,
wood scraps and sawdust. In short, if we want the emotional
comfort that can be drawn from a fireplace, we shall have to
learn to use the fireplace in a concentrated way, producing our
own fuel from materials that would otherwise go to waste in our
neighborhoods. It is easy to imagine, a simple hand press which
people can use in their homes to press this waste into dense "logs"
to make the fire more substantial.
Assume then that we are to have some kind of fireplaceperhaps
something entirely simple, but an open fire nonetheless.
Where shall we put it/ There are four points to consider:
I. Certainly, the main fireplace should be located in the comBUILDINGS
mon area of the house.  t will help to draw people together in
this area, and when it is burning, it provides a kind of counterpoint
to conversation.
 However, the fireplace should be in view for people passing
through the room and people in adjoining rooms, especially the
kitchen. The fire will tend to pull people ·in and make it more
likely for the family to gather. And also it is good to view the
fire in passing. A welcome time for a fire is in the evening when
the family is gathering for the evening meal; and the activity
tends to balance between the kitchen and the fire.
 Make certain, too, that there is a space where people
can sit in front of the fire; and that this space is not cut by
paths between doors or adjacent rooms.
 And be sure that the fire is not a dead place when the
fire is not burning. A fireplace without a fire, full of ashes and
dark, will turn the chairs away, unless the chairs which face the
fire when it is lit face something else-a window, or activity, or
a view-when it is not lit. Only then will the circle of chairs
which forms around the fire be stable and keep the place alive,
both when the fire is burning and when it isn't.
A daytime focus.
Therefore:
Build the fire in a common space-perhaps in the kitchen
-where it provides a natural focus for talk and dreams and
thought. Adjust the location until it knits together the social
spaces and rooms around it, giving them each a glimpse
of the fire; and make a window or some other focus to
sustain the place during the times when the fue is out.

Even where the traditional open fireplace is obsolete for heating
or where fuel is scarce, find some way of converting refuse, paper,
scraps of wood and cardboard into logs which can be burned, and
which smell good-perhaps with some kind of natural resin in a
home-made press. Burn all the dry organic materials that do not
go to the COMPOST ), so that the leftovers from the materials
which come into the house all serve a useful function, either as
fertilizer or as fuel; indeed, the ashes from the fire may go into
the compost. Make a circle of chairs around the fire-SITTING
CIRCLE 5); perhaps these chairs include a WINDOW PLACE
( I So).
I  EATING ATMOSPHERE
... we have already pointed out how vitally important all kinds
of communal eating are in helping to maintain a bond among a
group of people-COMMUNAL EATING ); and we have given
some idea of how the common eating may be placed as part of the
kitchen itself-FARMHOUSE KITCHEN  I ). This pattern gives
some details of the eating atmosphere.
When people eat together, they may actually be together
in spirit-or they may be far apart. Some rooms invite
people to eat leisurely and comfortably and feel together,
while others force people to eat as quickly as possible so
they can go somewhere else to relax.
Above all, when the table has the same light all over it, and
has the same light level on the walls around it, the light does
nothing to hold people together; the intensity of feeling is quite
likely to dissolve; there is little sense that there is any special
kind of gathering. But when there is a soft light, hung low over
the table, with dark walls around so that this one point of light
lights up people's faces and is a focal point for the whole group,
then a meal can become a special thing indeed, a bond, communion.
Therefore:
Put a heavy table in the center of the eating spacelarge
enough for the whole family or the group of people
using it. Put a light over the table to create a pool of light
over the group, and enclose the space with walls or with
contrasting darkness. Make the space large enough so the
chairs can be pulled back comfortably, and provide shelves
and counters close at hand for things related to the meal.

I   WORKSPACE ENCLOSURE**
... this pattern plays a vital role in helping to create an atmosphere
in which people can work effectively. You can use it
piecemeal to generate the larger patterns for workspace like FLEXIBLE
OFFICE SPACE ), HALF-PRIVATE OFFICE 2), and
HOME WORKSHOP  I  ). Or, of conrse, it can be used to help
complete these larger patterns, if you have already built them
into your design. Even in an alcove off the family commonsALCOVES
( I ), you can make the workspace more suitable for
work, by placing and shaping the enclosure immediately around
it according to this pattern.

People cannot work effectively if their workspace is too
enclosed or too exposed. A good workspace strikes the
balance.
In many offices, people are either completely enclosed and
feel too isolated, or they are in a completely open area as in the
office landscape and feel too exposed. It is hard for a person to
work well at either of these two extremes-the problem is to find
the right balance between the two.
To find the proper balance, we conducted a simple experiment.
We first defined  variables, which we thought might
influence a person's sense of enclosure in his workspace.
These I  variables are:
 Presence or absence of a wall immediately behind you.
 Presence or absence of a wall immediately beside you.
 Amount of open space in front of you.
 Area of the workspace.
 Total amount of enclosure around the immediate workspace.
 View to the outside.
 Distance to nearest person.
 Number of people you are aware of from your workplace.
 Noise: level and type.
IO. Presence or absence of a person facing you directly.
I . Number of different positions you can sit in.
BUILDINGS
 . Number of people you can see from your workspace.
 The number of people you can talk to without raising
your voice.
We then formulated thirteen hypotheses which connect these
variables with the comfort of the work space. The hypotheses
are listed below. We interviewed  men and women who had
all worked in several different offices. In the interview, we first
asked each person to think of the very best workspace he  or she)
had ever worked in and the very worst; and then asked him  or
her to make a sketch plan of both spaces. Then we asked questions
to identify the value of each of these  variables in the
"best" and "worst" workspaces. Thus, for instance, we might
point to one of the sketches a person had drawn, and say "How
far away was that wall" to establish the value of the third variable.
The values of the variables for the  best and worst workspaces
are given in the following table.
On the basis of this table, we then calculated the probable
significance of our hypotheses, according to the chi-squared
test. Nine of the hypotheses appear to be significant according to
the chi-squared test, and four are not. We now list the nine
"significant" hypotheses, and with each one, in parentheses, we
venture an explanation for its success.
 You feel more comfortable in a workspace if there is a wall
behind you. If your back is exposed you feel vulnerable-you
can never tell if someone is looking at you, or if someone is
coming toward you from behind. The data support this hypothesis
at the I per cent level of significance.
 You feel more comfortable in a workspace it there is a wall
to one side. If your workspace is open in front and on both
sides, you feel too exposed. This is probably due to the fact that
though it is possible to be vaguely aware of everything that goes
on  degrees around you, you cannot feel in real control of
such a wide angle without moving your head all the time. If
you have a wall on one side, you only have to manage an angle
of  degrees, which is much easier, so you feel more secure.)
The data support this hypothesis at the  per cent level of significance.
 There should be no blank wall closer than  feet in front of
you. As you work you want to occasionally look up and rest your

If there is a blank wall closer than  feet your eyes will not

 No other person should work closer than  feet to your

the phone or in person with someone, without feeling as
though someone else can hear every word you are saying. The

than  feet to you are virtually forced to overhear your conversations.

 It is uncomfortable if you a re not aware of at least two
other persons while you work. On the other hand, you do not
want to be aware of more than eight people. If you are aware
of more than eight people, you lose a sense of where you are in
the whole organization. You feel like a cog in a huge machine.
You are exposed to too many people. On the other hand, if you
are not aware of anyone else around you, you feel isolated
and as though no one cares about you or your work. In this case,
you are too enclosed. The data support this hypothesis at the
 per cent level of significance.
 You should not be able to hear noises very different from
the kind of noise you make, from your workplace. Your workplace
should be sufficiently enclosed to cut out noises which are of
a different kind from the ones you make. There is some evidence
that one can concentrate on a task better if people around him
are doing the same thing, not something else. The data support
this hypothesis at the  per cent level of significance.
Four of the hypotheses we tested were not supported to a
statistically significant extent by the data. They are the following:

 No one should be sitting directly opposite you and facing
you.
I . Workspaces should allow you to face in different directions.
I . From your workspace, you should be able to see at least
two other persons; but no more than four.

or to the side. If there are other people working nearby,

eight workspaces within view or earshot of one another.

 COOKING LAYOUT*
... within the FARMHOUSE KITCHEN  I ), or any other kind
of kitchen, it is essential that the cooking area be fashioned as a
workshop for the preparation of food, and not as some kind of
magazine kitchen with built-in counters and decorator colors. This
down-to-earth and working character of a good kitchen comes in
large part from the arrangement of the stove and food and
counter.

Cooking is uncomfortable if the kitchen counter s too
short and also if it is too long.
Efficiency kitchens never live up to their name. They are based
on the notion that the best arrangement is one that saves the most
steps; and this has led to tiny, compact kitchens. These compact
layouts do save steps, but they usually don't have enough counter
space. Preparing dinner for a family is a complex operation; several
things must go on at once, and this calls for the simultaneous use
of counter space for different projects. If there isn't enough
counter space, then the ingredients and utensils for one thing
must be moved, washed, or put away before the next thing can be
prepared; or else things become so jumbled that extra time and
effort must be taken to find what's needed at the proper moment.
On the other hand, if the counter is too long or too spread out,
the various points along its length are too far apart-and cooking
is again uncomfortable, because your movements as you cook are
so inefficient and slow.
Empirical support for the notion that there is insufficient
counter space in many kitchens comes from a recent work by the
Small Hornes Council, University of Illinois. The Council found
that in over a hundred housing developments,  per cent had
too little counter space. No one complained that their kitchens
were too large.
In The Owner Built Home Yellow Springs, Ohio,  ,
Volume IV, p. 0), Ken Kern notes that a principal concept in
cooking design is to provide for storage and workspace at each of
I  COOKING LAYOUT
the major cooking centers in the kitchen. Drawing on a Cornell
University study he identifies the major cooking centers as the
sink, the stove, the refrigerator, the mixing, and the serving areas.
To provide storage for each center requires I  to I  feet of
free counter space, excluding the sink, drainboards, and stove.
(The Cornell Kitchen, Glenn Beyer, Cornell University, 52.)
As far as the limits on the distance between these major cooking
centers are concerned, there is less empirical evidence. Estimates
vary. The rule of thumb we postulate is that no two of them
should be more than three or four steps, or about Io feet, apart.
A kitchen t!tat really ,works: !tuge, but great.
Therefore:
To strike the balance between the kitchen which is too
small, and the kitchen which is too spread out, place the
stove, sink, and food storage and counter in such a way
that:
I. No two of the four are more than  feet apart.
 The total length of counter-excluding sink, stove,
and refrigerator-is at least  feet.
 No one section of the counter is less than  feet long.
There is no need for the counter to be continuous or
entirely "built-in" as it is in many modern kitchens-it can
even consist of free-standing tables or counter tops. Only
the three functional relationships described above are critical.

I   SITTING CIRCLE*
... according to the SEQUENCE OF SITTING SPACES 2), there
will be a vHiety of different kinds of sitting space throughout an
oflice bL1ilding or a house or workshop-some formal, some informal,
some large, some small, laid ant in part according to
the INTIMACY GRADIENT  ). This pattern deals with the
actual physical layout of any one of these sitting spaces. And of
course, it can be used to help create the sequence of sitting spaces,
piecemeal, one space at a time.

A group of chairs, a sofa and a chair, a pile of cushions
-these are the most obvious things in everybody's lifeand
yet to make them work, so people become animated
and alive in them, is a very subtle business. Most seating
arrangements are sterile, people avoid them, nothing ever
happens there. Others seem somehow to gather life around
them, to concentrate and liberate energy. What is the
difference between the two?
Most important of all, perhaps, is their pos1t10n. A s1tt1ng
circle needs essentially the same position as a COMMON AREA AT
THE HEART ), but in miniature: a well defined area, with
paths rnnning past it, not cutting through it, and placed so that
people naturally pass by it, stop and talk, lean on the backs of
chairs, gradually sit down, move position, get up again. These
characteristics are vital. The reasons are exactly the same as those
given in COMMON AREAS AT THE HEART  ); only the scale is
different.
Second, the rough shape of a circle. When people sit down to
talk together they try to arrange themselves roughly in a circle.
Empirical evidence for this has been presented by Margaret Mead
("Conference Behavior," Columbia University Forum, Summer,
I 67, pp. 0- ). Perhaps one reason for the circle, as opposed
to other forms, is the fact that people like to sit at an angle to
one another, not side by side Robert Sommer, "Studies in
Personal Space," Sociometry,  September 59, pp. -60.)
I   SITTING CIRCLE
In a circle, even neighbors are at a slight angle to one another.
This, together with the first point, suggests that a rough circle is
best.
But it is not enough for the chairs to be in a circle. The chairs
themselves will only hold this position if the actual architecturethe
columns, walls, fire, windows-subtly suggest a partly contained,
defined area, which i  roughly a circle. The fire especially
helps to anchor a sitting circle. Other things can do it almost as
well.
Third, we have observed that the seating arrangement needs to
be slightly loose-not too formal. Relatively loose arrangements,
where there are many different sofas, cushions, and chairs, all
free to move, work to bring a sitting circle to life. The chairs can
be adjusted slightly, they can be turned at slight angles; and if
there are one or two too many, all the better: this seems to animate
the group. People get up and walk around, then sometimes sit
back down in a new chair.
Therefore:
Place each sitting space in a position which is protected,
not cut by paths or movement, roughly circular, made so
that the room itself helps to suggest the circle-not too
strongly-with paths and activities around it, so that people
naturally gravitate toward the chairs when they get into
the mood to sit. Place the chairs and cushions loosely in
the circle, and have a few too many.

I  COMMUNAL SLEEPING
... by this time the sleeping areas have been defined-coUPLE's
REALM( ), CHILDREN'SR EALM( ), SLEEPINGT O THE EAST
( I  ), BED CLUSTER  I 3). It remains only to build in the actual
detailed space which forms the beds themselves-MARRIAGE BED
( I 7), BED ALCOVE  I  ). However, before we consider these
patterns, we wish to draw attention to a slightly more general
pattern which may affect their detailed positions.
In many traditional and primitive cultures, sleep is a
communal activity without the sexual overtones it has in
the West today. We believe that it may be a vital social
function, which plays a role as fundamental and as necessary
to people as communal eating.
For instance, in Indian villages during the dry season the
men pull their beds into the compound at sundown and talk and
smoke together, then drift off to sleep. It is a vital part of the
social life of the community. The experience of the campfire is
the closest western equivalent: people's love of camping suggests
that the urge is still a common one.
It is possible that sleep as a communal activity may be a vital
part of healthy social life, not only for children, but for all
adults. How might we harmonize this need with the obvious facts
of privacy and sexuality that are linked with sleeping/
Of course, it is a beautifully intimate thing-the moment in the
morning and at night when a couple are together, in private,
falling asleep or waking up together. But we believe that it is also
possible to create a situation where, occasionally, people can sleep
together in big, family-size groups.
In particular, we can imagine a special version of this activity
for metropolitan culture, where so often friends live many miles

BUILDINGS
away from each other. How many times have you experienced
this situation: You have been out for the night with your friends
and end up back at their house for drinks, to talk, to build a fire.
Finally, late into the night, it is time to leave. Often they will
say, "Please, spend the night"-but this rarely happens. You decline,
and make the weary, half-drunken drive home to "your own
bed."
It seems to us that under these conditions especially, communal
sleeping makes sense. It would help to intensify the social occasions
when we do see our friends who live far away.
But the environment must invite it, or we shall never overcome
our reluctance. People are uneasy about spending the night
because it usually means having to make up a guest bed, or sleeping
on the rug, or cramped on the sofa. Think how much more
inviting it would be if, at the end of the night, people simply
dozed off, in ones and twos, in alcoves, and on mats with quilts,
around the main sleeping area of the house, or around the commons.
From a practical point of view, there are two alternative positions
for the alcoves:
I. There might be a place in the commons-not in any one
person's private space-a place where late at night after people
have been together for the evening and the fire is dying out, it is
simple to draw together and sleep-a place where children and
parents can sleep together on special nights. It could be very
simple: one large mat and some blankets.
 The other solution is a more deliberate version of the pattern:
the couple's realm in a family house could be slightly larger
than normal, with one or two alcoves or window seats that could
double as beds. A built-in seat, for example, that is wide enough
and Jong enough to lay down on, with a thin mat spread across
it, becomes a bed. A few places like this, and, at a moment's
notice the couple's bedroom becomes a setting for communal
sleeping.
In either case, the solution mnst be simple and must involve
nothing more than reaching for a blanket and a mat. If special
beds must be made and the room rearranged, it will never happen.
And, of course, the sp;ice for guest's beds must be made so that
it is not dead when it is not used for sleeping. It needs a com-

I  COMMUNAL SLEEPING
patible double function-a place to put a crib, a seat, a place to
lay out clothes-ALCOVE ), WINDOW PLACE 0), DRESSING
ROOM  I ),
This pattern may seem strange at fi.rst, but when our typist,
read it, she was fascinated and decided to try it one Saturday
night with her family. They spread a big mat across the living
room. They all got up together and helped the youngest son on
his paper route; then they had some breakfast. Ed: Are they still
doing itl / Au: No, after  weeks they were arrested.
Seriously though:
Arrange the sleeping area so that there is the possibility
for children and adults to sleep in the same space, in sight
and sound of one another, at least as an occasional alternative
to their more usual sleeping habits.
This can be done in the common area near the fireplace,
where the entire household and guests can sleep togetherone
large mat and some blankets in an alcove. It is also
possible to build bed alcoves for overnight guests, in an
extended couple's realm.
beds within sight and sound of other beds
Place the ALCOVES  and MARRIAGE BED 7 and the
BED ALCOVES 8 and DRESSING ROOMS  accordingly.
The children have this pattern for themselves already-if bed alcoves
are placed in a cluster-BED CLUSTER  I 3).

I  MARRIAGE BED
... the pattern COUPLE'S REALM  I  gives emphasis to the
importance of the couple's private life together within a household.
Within that couple's realm, the placing and nature of the
bed is naturally the most important thing.

The bed is the center of a couple's life together: the place
where they lie together, talk, make love, sleep, sleep late,
take care of each other during illness. But beds and bedrooms
are not often made in ways which intensify their
meaning, and these experiences cannot take hold.
It is true that there are extra wide beds, special bedspreads
and frames, water beds, soft lighting, and all kinds of accessories
on the night table. But these are all essentially gadgets. They still
don't make a bed which nourishes intimacy and love.
There are three far more basic points which go to establish
the marriage bed.
I. The space around the bed is shaped around the bed. There
is a low ceiling, or a partial ceiling, over the bed. The walls and
windows are made to contain the bed. See BED ALCOVE   ).
 It is crucial that the couple choose the right time to
build the bed, and not buy one at the drop of the hat. It is unlikely
that the_ bed can come to have the right feeling until a
couple has weathered some hard times together and there is some
depth to their experience.
 Find a way of adding to the bed and the space around it,
so that it will become more personal and unique over the years;
for e)\"ample, a headboard that can be carved, painted, repainted,
or a cloth ceiling that can be changed, embroidered.
The importance of the bed as an anchor point in a couple's
life is brought home in this passage from Homer. Odysseus is
home after  years of wandering and misadventure. His wife,
Penelope, does not recognize him-there have been so many
imposters, and he has been away so long. He pleads with her to
believe it is him, but she is unsure. Frustrated, Odysseus turns
away from her. Penelope speaks:

BUILDINGS
"Strange man, I am not proud, or contemptuous, or offended,
but I know what manner of man you were when you sailed away
from Ithaca. Come Eurycleia, make the bed outside the room
which h  built himself; put the fine bedstead outside, and lay out
the rugs and blankets and fleeces."
This was a little trap for her husband. He burst into a rage:
"Wife, that has cut me to the heart I Who has moved my bed?
That would be a difficult job for the best workman, unless God
himself should coine down and move it. It would be easy for God,
but no man could easily prize it up, not the strongest man living!
There is a great secret in that bed. I made it myself, and no one
else touched it. There was a strong young olive tree in full leaf
growing in an enclosure, the trunk as thick as a pillar. Round this
I built our bridal chamber; I did the whole thing myself, laid the
stones and built a good roof over it, jointed the doors and fitted
them in their places. After that I cut off the branches and trimmed
the trunk from the root up, smoothed it carefully with the adze and
made it straight to the line. This tree I made the bedpost. That
was the beginning of my bed; I bored holes through it, and fitted
the other posts about it, and inlaid the framework with gold and
silver and ivory, and I ran through it leather straps coloured purple.
Now I have told you my secret. And I don't know if it is still
there, wife, or if some one has cut the olive at the root and moved
my bed!"
She was conquered, she could hold out no longer when Odysseus
told the secret she knew so well. She burst into tears and ran straight
to him, throwing her arms about his neck. She kissed his head, and
cried:
"Don't be cross with me, my husband, you were always a most
understanding man! The gods brought affliction upon us because they
grudged us the joy of being young and growing old together!
Don't be angry, don't be hurt because I did not take you in my
arms as soon as I saw you I My heart has been frozen all this time
with a fear that some one would come and deceive me with a false
tale; there were so many imposters I But now you have told me the
secret of our bed, that settles it." From The Odyssey, translated by
W. H. D. Rouse. Reprinted by arrangement with The New American
Library, Inc., New York, New York.)
The translator footnotes this incident as follows: "This is the
first time in all the eventful tale when Odysseus speaks on impulse;
he has been prepared for everything, but this unexpected
trifle unlocks his heart."
Quite honestly, we are not certain whether or not this pattern
makes sense. On the one hand, it does: it is a beautiful idea;
idyllic almost. Yet, face to face with cold hard fact and with the

I  MARRIAGE BED
dissolution and struggles in the marriages around us, it seems hard
to hope that it could ever be quite real. We have decided to leave
it in, just because it is a beautiful idea. But we ask you to treat
it like Oblomov's dream, a picture more real than reality, an
impossible dream of perfect and idyllic circumstances, which may
help perhaps, to make a little more sense of our muddled everyday
reality-but only if we take it with a pinch of salt.
Therefore:
At the right moment in a couple's life, it is important
that they make for themselves a special bed-an intimate
anchor point for their lives; slightly enclosed, with a low
ceiling or a canopy, with the room shaped to it; perhaps
a tiny room built around the bed with many windows.
Give the bed some shape of its own, perhaps as a fourposter
with head board that can be hand carved or painted
over the years.

... bed alcoves help to generate the form of BED CLUSTERS

For children, each alcove also functions as A ROOM OF ONE's OWN
( I 1), so that even in the smallest house, not only tne adults, but
every child can have at least a small place to call his own .
••• ❖ ❖
Bedrooms make no sense.
The valuable space around the bed is good for nothing except
access to the bed. And all the other functions-dressing, working,
and storage of personal belongings which people stuff uncomfortably
into the corners of their bedrooms-in fact, need their own
space, and are not at all well met by the left over areas around a
bed.
In BED CLUSTERS  3), we have already argued that each
child in a family should have a bed alcove of his own, opening
off a common play-space. This is based purely on the balance
betvvecn community and privacy. vVe shall now try to establish
the fact that, for everyone in the house, isolated beds, not only
those in clusters, are better off in alcoves than in bedrooms. There
are two reasons.
First, the bed in a bedroom creates awkward spaces around it:
dressing, working, watching television, sitting, are all rather
foreign to the side spaces left over around a bed. We have found
that people have a hard time adapting the space around the bed
to their needs for bedroom space.
Second, the bed itself seems more comfortable in a space that
is adjusted to it. In our design experiments, where lay people
have used these p;itterns to design their own houses, we have
noticed a rather strong urge to give the bed a nook of its own,
some kind of enclosure. Apparently this particular pattern strikes
a chord in people.
Once the bed has been built into a space that is right for ir,
then the rest of the bedrom space is free to shape itself arnnnd
the needs for sitting space, play areas, dressing, and storage.
BUILDINGS
What are the issues at stake in making a good bed alcove!
Spacionsness. Don't make it too tight. It must be comfortable
to get in and out and to make the bed. If the alcove is going to
function as A ROOM OF oNE's OWN 1 for a child, then it
needs to be ;ilrnost a tiny room, with one wall missing.
Six bed alco·ves in one of our houses in Peru,
Ventilation. Bed alcoves need fresh air; at least a vent of some
kind that is adjustable, and better still a window.
Privacy. People will want to draw into the alcove and be private.
The opening of the alcove needs a curtain or some other
kind of enclosure.
Ceiling. According to the arguments developed with the pattern
CEILING HEIGHT VARIETY 0), the bed, as an intimate
social space for one or two, needs a ceiling height somewhat lower
than the room beside it.
Bed alcoves off a family room.
Therefore:
Don't put single beds in empty rooms called bedrooms,
but instead put individual bed alcoves off rooms with other
nonsleeping functions, so the bed itself becomes a tiny
private haven.

gradually-this pattern plays an essential role. It will

I  DRESSING ROOMS*
... if the beds are in pos1tton-MARRIAGE BED  I  ), BED
ALCOVES 8)-wc can give detailed attention to the dressing
spaces-both to the closets where people keep their clothes and
to the space they use for dressing. These dressing spaces may also
help to form the BATHING ROOM  I 4).
Dressing and undressing, storing clothes, having clothes
lying around, have no reason to be part of any larger
complex of activities. Indeed they disturb other activities:
they are so self-contained that they themselves need concentrated
space which has no other function.
We have argued, in BED ALCOVES  8), that the concept of
the bedroom leads to wasted space around the bed. This pattern
lends further support to the idea that "bedrooms" in their present
form are not valuable entities to have in a house.
The arguments are:
I. Clothes lying around are messy; they can take over a great
deal of space; they need some kind of individual space. A dressing
space can be for one person or shared by a couple. The important
thing is that it be organized as a small space where it is comfortable
to store clothes and to dress. When such a space is not
provided, t/ie w!iole beriroom is potentially the dressing room;
and this can destroy its integrity as a room. It becomes more a
big closet to "keep neat," than a room to stay in and relax.
 People tend to take up a private position while they dress,
even where they are relatively intimate with the people they live
with. Even in a locker room, people will make a half-turn away
from others as they dress. This suggests that the space for dressing
be relatively private. The old fashioned standing screens in a
green room or a boudoir worked this way; they created a halfprivate
dressing space.
 The time of dressing, the activity, is a natural moment of
transition in the day. It is a time when people think about the
day ahead, or unwind at the end of the day and get ready for
bed. If you dwell, for a moment, on this transitional quality of
BUILDINGS
dressing, it seems clear that the dressing space can be made to
help support it. For example, a good place to dress will have
beautiful natural light; this requires as much thought in your
design as any room-see, for example, LIGHT ON TWO SIDES OF
EVERY ROOM ).
 The dressing space should be large enough, with room to
stretch your arms and turn around. This means six or seven
feet of open area. It must also have about six feet of clothes
hanging space, another six feet of open shelves, and a few
drawers for each person. These figures are rough. Check your
own closet and shelves, think about what you really need, and
make an estimate.
Therefore:
Give everyone a dressing room-either private or shared
-between their bed and the bathing room. Make this dressing
room big enough so there is an open area in it at least
six feet in diameter; about six linear feet of clothes hanging
space; and another six feet of open shelves; two or
three drawers; and a mirror.

... this pattern helps to form the rooms. It therefore helps to
complete all the patterns which define rooms, or arcades, or
balconies, or outdoor rooms or minor rooms: in short, just about
all of the last I oo patterns. If you have been imagining these
spaces while you walk about on the actual site, then all these
spaces will already be three-dimensional in your mind: they will
be volumes of space, not merely areas on plan. Now, with this
pattern, which determines ceiling heights, the next pattern which
determines the exact shape of each room, and the remaining patterns
in the language, we fill out this three dimensional conception
of the building.
A building in which the ceiling heights are all the same
is virtually incapable of making people comfortable.
In some fashion, low ceilings make for intimacy, high ceilings
for formality. In older ·buildings which allowed the ceiling
heights to vary, this was almost taken for granted. However, in
buildings which are governed by standard components, it is very
hard to make the ceiling height vary from room to room, so it
tends to be forgotten. And people are willing to let it go,
because they have forgotten what an important psychological
reason there is for making the heights vary.
We have presented three different theories over the years in
our attempts to explain the significance of ceiling height variety,
and we shall present the evolution of all three theories here, because
it puts the matter in perspective and will perhaps allow you
to formulate the pattern most coherently for yourself.
Theory one. The ceiling height should be related to the
length and breadth of the room, because the problem is one of
proportion, and people feel comfortable or uncomfortable according
to the room's proportions.
Many efforts have been made to establish rules which will make
sure that rooms are "well proportioned." Thus, for instance,
Palladio laid down three rules of proportion: all of them shared
BUILDINGS
the feature that the height of a room should be intermediate between
its length and its breadth.
In traditional Japanese architecture, this idea is captured by a
simple rule of thumb. The ceiling height of a room is  feet
inches+ . X the number of tatami in the room inches. This
creates a direct relationship between floor area and ceiling height.
A very small room  mats has a ceiling height of  feet  inches.
A large room  I  mats has a ceiling height of  feet I I inches.
(See Heinrich Engle, The Japanese House, Rutland Vermont:
Charles E. Tuttle Company, I 64, pp. - I.)
However sound this approach may seem in certain cases, it is
clearly not a completely valid geometric principle. There are
many rooms with extremely low ceilings, especially in cottages
and informal houses, which are extremely pleasant-even though
they violate Palladio's principle and the Japanese rule of thumb
utterly.
Theory two. The ceiling height is related to the social distance
between people in the room, and is therefore directly related to
their relative intimacy or nonintimacy.
This theory makes it clear what is wrong with badly proportioned
rooms, and gives the beginning of a functional basis for
establishing the right height for different spaces. The problem
hinges on the question of appropriate social distance. It is known
that in various kinds of social situations there are appropriate and
inappropriate distances between people. See Edward Hall, The
Silent Language, New York: Doubleday, 59, pp. 3-64; and
Robert Sommer, "The Distance for Comfortable Conversation,"
Sociometry, , 62, pp. I I -16. Now, the ceiling height in
a room has a bearing on social distance in two ways:
A. The height of a ceiling appears to affect the apparent distance
of sound sources from a hearer. Thus, under a low ceiling
sound sources seem nearer than they really are; under a high
ceiling they seem further than they really are.
Since the sound is an important cue in the perception of distance
between people voice, footstep, rustle, and so on), this
means that the ceiling height will alter the apparent distance
between people. Under a high ceiling people seem further apart
than they actually are.
I CEILING HEIGHT VARIETY
On the basis of this effect, it is clear that intimate situations
require very low ceilings, less intimate situations require higher
ceilings, formal places require high ceilings, and the most public
situations require the highest ceilings: for example, the canopy
over the double bed, a fireside nook, high-ceilinged formal reception
room, Grand Central Station.
B. Through the medium of three-dimensional "bubbles". We
know that each social situation has a certain horizontal dimension
or diameter. We may think of this as a kind of membrane
or bubble which encloses the situation. It is likely that this
bubble needs a vertical component-equal in height to its diameter.
If so, the height of the ceiling should, for comfort, be
equal to the dominant social distance in the room. Since people
in Grand Central :ue strangers, and have an effective social
distance of as much as I oo feet, this would explain why the
ceiling has to be very high; similarly, in an intimate nook, or
over a double bed, where the social distance is no more than
five or six feet, the ceiling has to be very low.
Theory three. Although both of the previous theories contain
valuable insights, they must be at least slightly wrong because they
assume that the absolute ceiling height in any one room has a
critical functional effect. In fact, the absolute ceiling height does
not matter as much as one would expect from theories one and
two.
For example, the most intimate room in an igloo may be no
more than five feet high; yet in a very hot climate even the
most intimate rooms may be nine feet high. This makes it clear
that the absolute height of rooms is governed by other factors
too--climate and culture. Obviously, then, no theory which prescribes
an absolute height for any given social situation, or room
size, can be correct. What then, is going on? Why do ceiling
heights vary? What functional effect does their variation have?
We have been led, finally, to the conclusion that it is the
variation itself which matters, not merely the absolute height in
any given room. For if a building contains rooms with several
different ceiling heights in it and the height has an effect on
social relationships for the reasons given), then the mere fact
that the ceiling heights vary, allows people to move from high
BUILDINGS
rooms to low rooms, and vice versa, according to th.e degree of
intimacy they seek-because they know that everyone correlates
intimacy with ceiling height.
According to this theory, the effect of the ceiling height is not
direct; there is instead a complex interaction between people
and space, in which people read the different ceiling heights in a
building as messages, and take up positions according to these
messages. They are comfortable or uncomfortable according to
whether they can take part in this process, and can then feel
secure in the knowledge that they have chosen a place of appropriate
intimacy.
Finally, some special notes are required on the implementation
of this pattern. In a one story structure there is no problem; the
ceiling heights may vary freely. In buildings with several stories
however, it is not so clear cut. The floors of the upper stories
must be more or less flat; and this obviously creates problems as
you try to vary the ceiling heights underneath. Here arc some
notes which may help you to solve this problem:
r. Build storage between floors and ceilings-at least two feet
deep-where you want to lower ceiling heights.
Storage over a low ceiling.
 Put two alcoves over each other. If each is  feet  inche5,
this gives a main ceiling of I  feet, which is good for very public

 It is very important to have some rooms witn ceilings as
low as  feet or  feet  incnes-these are very beautiful.
 Except in one-story buildings, the low ceilinged rooms will
make most sense on upper stories; indeed, tne average ceiling
height will probably get lower and lower witn successive stories
-the most public rooms, for the largest gatherings, are typically
on the ground, and rooms get progressively more intimate the
further they are from the ground.
Lower ceilings 1pstain.
Therefore:
Vary the ceiling heights continuously throughout the
building, especially between rooms which open into each
other, so that the relative intimacy of different spaces can
be felt. In particular, make ceilings high in rooms which
are public or meant for large gatherings  to  feet),
lower in rooms for smaller gatherings  to  feet), and

THE SHAPE OF
INDOOR SPACE**
... from CEILING HEIGHT VARIETY 0 you have an overall
conception of each floor in the building as a cascade of heights,
typically highest in the middle where the largest rooms are,
lower toward the edge where the small rooms are, and varying
with floor also, so that the lower floors will tend to have a
higher average ceiling height than upper floors. This pattern
takes each individual space, within this overall cascade, and gives
it a more definite shape.
The perfectly crystalline squares and rectangles of ultramodern
architecture make no special sense in human or
in structural terms. They only express the rigid desires and
fantasies which people have when they get too preoccupied
with systems and the means of their production.

To get away from this madness a new wave of thought has
thrown the right angle away completely. Many of the new
organic technologies create buildings and rooms shaped more or
less like wombs and holes and caves.
BUILDINGS
pseudo biological
But these biological rooms are as irrational, as much based on
images and fantasies as the rigid crystals they are trying to replace.
When we think about the human forces acting on rooms,
we see that they need a shape which lies between the two. There
are reasons why their sides should be more or less straight; and
there are reasons why their angles, or many of them anyway,
should be rough right angles. Yet their sides have no good reason
to be perfectly equal, their angles have no good reason to be perfectly
right angles. They only need to be irregular, rough, imperfect
rectangles.
The core of our argument is this. We pos.tulate that every
space, which is recognizable and walled enough to be distinct,
must have walls which are roughly straight, except when the
walls are thick enough to be concave in both directions.
The reason is simple. Every wall has social spaces on both
sides of it. Since a social space is convex-see the extensive argument
in POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE 06)-it must either have a
wall which is concave thus forming a convex space or a wall
which is perfectly straight. But any "thin" wall which is concave
toward one side, will be convex toward the other and will, therefore,
leave a concave space on at least one side.

A thin wall, makes a convex space on one side,
and destroys the other side.
Essentially then, every wall with social sp,ces on both sides
of it, must have straight walls, except where it is thick enough
to be concave on both sides. And, of course, a wall may be
curved whenever there is no significant social space on the outside
of it. This happens sometimes in a position where an entrance
butts out into a street, or where a bay window stands in a
part of a garden which is unharmed by it.
A place qv/,ere a wall can be cur-ved,
becawe it works with the outside.
So much for the walls. They must most often be roughly
straight. Now for the angles between walls. Acute angles are
hardly ever appropriate, for reasons of social integrity again. It is
an uphill struggle to make an acute angle in a room, which works.
Since the argument for convexity rules out angles of more than
I  degrees, th is means that the corners of spaces must almost

And one further word about the angles. Most often rooms will
pack in such a way that angles somewhere near right angles say
between  and I oo degrees make most sense. The reason,
simply, is that other obtuse angles do not pack well at corners
where several rooms meet. Here are the most likely typical kinds
of corners:
_L -+--+ -1--
Only angles that are nearly right angles pack successfully.
This means that the majority of spaces in a building must be
polygons, in plan, with roughly straight walls and obtuse-angled
corners. Most often they will probably be irregular, squashed,
rough rectangles. Indeed, respect for the site and the subtleties
of the plan will inevitably lead to slightly irregular shapes. And
occasionally they may have curved walls-either if the wall is
thick enough to be concave on both sides or, on an exterior wall,
where there is no important social space outside.

 THE SHAPE OF INDOOR SPACE
A final point. Our experience has led us to an even stronger
version of this pattern-which constrains the shape of ceilings too.
Specifically, we believe that people feel uncomfortable in spaces
like these:
Rooms whose ceilings can make you uncomfortable.
We can only speculate on the possible reasons for these feelings.
It seems just possible that they originate from some kind of
desire for a person to be surrounded by a spherical bubble roughly
related to the human axis. Room shapes which are more or less
versions of this bubble are comfortable; while those which depart
from it strongly are uncomfortable. Perhaps when the space around
us is too sharply different from the imaginary social bubble
around us, we do not feel quite like persons.
The shape of the space bubble.
A ceiling that is flat, vaulted in one direction or vaulted in two
directions, has the necessary character. A ceiling sloping to one
side does not. We must emphasize that this conjecture is not intended
as an argument in favor of rigidly simple or symmetric
spaces. It only speaks against those rather abnormal spaces with
one-sided sloping ceilings, high apexed ceilings, weird bulges into
the room, and re-entrant angles in the wall.
BUILDINGS
Therefore:
With occasional exceptions, make each indoor space or
each position of a space, a rough rectangle, with roughly
straight walls, near right angles in the corners, and a
roughly symmetrical vault over each room.

give each room its shape: LIGHT ON TWO SIDES OF EVERY ROOM
( I )' CEILING HEIGHT VARIETY  I 0)' and THE SHAPE OF
INDOOR SPACE 1). Once these patterns are clear, this pattern
helps to place the windows rather more precisely in the walls. It
defines just how many windows there should be, how far apart,
and what their total area should be.

Rooms without a view are prisons for the people who
have to stay in them.
When people are in a place for any length of time they need
to be able to refresh themselves by looking at a world different
from the one they are in, and with enough of its own variety
and life to provide refreshment.
Amos Rapoport gives written descriptions of three windowless
seminar rooms at the University of California. The descriptions
-by teachers and students of English who were asked to write
descriptions of the rooms as part of a writing exercise-are
heavily negative, even though they were not asked to be, and
in many cases refer directly to the windowless, bolled-in, or
isolated-from-the-world character of the rooms.
Here are two examples:
Room  is an unpleasant room in which to attend class because
in it one feels detached and isolated from the rest of the world
under the buzzing fluorescent lights and the high sound-proofed
ceilings, amid the sinks, cabinets, and pipes, surrounded by empty
space.

enclosing, and barren grey walls inspired neither disgust nor
liking; one might easily have forgotten how trapped one was. Amos

the sllbj ects gave "daylight" rather than "view" as a reason for
their choice. Bllt it is shown elsewhere in the same report that subjects
who are far from windows grossly overestimate the amount of
daylight they receive as compared with artificial light Office Design
p. ). This suggests that people want to be near windows
for other reasons over and above the daylight. Our conjecture that
it is the view which is critical is given more weight by the fact
that people are less interested in sitting near windows which open
onto light wells, which admit daylight, but present no view.
And Thomas Markus presents e1·idence which shows clearly that
office workers prefer windows with meaningful views-views of
city life, nature-as against views which also take in large areas, but
contain uninteresting and less meaningful elements. Thomas A.
Markus, "The Function of Windows: A Reappraisal," Building

Assume then that people do need to be able to look out of
windows, at some world different from their immediate surroundings.
\Ve now give very rough figures for the total area of the
windows in a room. The area of window needed will depend to
a large extent on climate, latitude, and the amount of reflecting
surfaces around the outside of the building. However, it is fairly
reasonable to believe that the floor/window ratio, though different
in different regions, may be more or less constant within
any given region.
We suggest, therefore, that yoll go round the town where you
live, and choose half a dozen rooms in which you really like the
light. In each case, measure the window area as a percentage of
the floor area; then take the average of the different percentages.
In our part of the world-Berkeley, California-we find that
rooms are most pleasant when they have about  per cent window-
sometimes as much as  per cent-(that is, - square
feet of window for every JOO square feet of floor). But we repeat,
obviously th is figure will vary enormously from one part of the
world to another. Imagine: Rabat, Timbuctoo, Antarctica, Northern
Norway, Italy, Brazilian jungle.

 HALF-OPEN WALL*
••. THE SHAPE OF INDOOR SPACE 1 defines the shapes of
rooms and minor rooms. This pattern gives more detail to the
walls between these rooms. Wherever there are HALF-PRIVATE

SITTING CIRCLES 5), BED ALCOVES 8), BUILDING
THOROUGHFARES 01), ARCADES 19), or THE FLOW THROUGH
ROOMS   ), the spaces must be given a subtle balance of enclosure
and openness by partly opening up the walls or keeping
them half-open.
Rooms which are too closed prevent the natural flow of
social occasions, and the natural process of transition from
one social moment to another. And rooms which are too
open will not support the difierentiation of events which
social life requires.
A solid room, for instance, with four walJs around it can
obviously sustain activities which are quite different from the
activities in the next room. In this sense it is excellent. But it is
very hard for people to join in these activities or leave them
naturally. This is only possible if the door is glazed, or if there is
a window in the wall, or if there is an opening, so that people
can gradually come forward, just when there is a lull in the conversation,
and naturally become a part of what is happening.
On the other hand, an open space with no walls around it,
just a place marked by a carpet on the floor and a chair arrangement,
but entirely open to the spaces all around it, is so exposed
that people never feel entirely comfortable there. No one activity
can establish itself because it is too vulnerable; and so the things
that happen there tend to be rather bland-a drink, reading the
paper, watching television, staring at the view, "sitting around":
you will not find animated conversations, arguments, excitement,
BUILDINGS
people making things, painting, card games, charades, or someone
practicing the violin. People Jet themselves go into these
more highly differentiated activities, when there is some degree
of enclosure around them-at least a half-wall, a railing, columns,
some separation from the other nearby spaces.
In short, the subtle conflict between exposure and enclosure
naturally requires a balance. But for some reason the modern
images of rooms and indoor space lead p-wple to the two extremes,
and hardly ever to the balance which is needed.
The kind of space which most easily supports both differentiation
of activities and the transition between different activities
has less enclosure than a solid room, and more enclosure-far more
-than a space inside an open plan.
A wall which is half-open, half-enclosed-an arch, a trellised
wall, a wall that is counter height with ornamented columns, a
walJ suggested by the reduction of the opening or the enlargement
of the columns at the corners, a colonnade of columns in the
wall-all these help get the balance of enclosure and openness
right; and in these places people feel comfortable as a result.
Examples.
From WORKSPACE ENCLOSURE  I 3 we have some evidence
for the amount of enclosure required. We found there that a
person is comfortable when he is about "half" enclosed-when he
has material around him on about t,· sides, or the four sides
around him are about half solid and half-open.
We therefore guess that the enclosure of any half-open wall
should itself consist of about  per cent void and  per cent
solid. This does not mean that it has to be a screen. For example,
I9J HALF-OPEN WALL
a combination of thick columns, deep beams, arched openings,
also creates this balance of openings and enclosures. A railing is
too open. But a balustrade with thick supports will often be just
right.
This applies very strongly to outdoor rooms and balconies; and
equally to all those indoor spaces which are connected to larger
rooms but partly separate from them-an alcove, workspace,
kitchen, bed. In all these cases the wall which forms the enclosure
and separates the smaller space from the larger one, needs to be
partially open and partially closed.
Among ourselves and many of our friends, we have found that
the urge to remodel a house is virtually one and the same with
the urge to create half-open walls between various parts of the
house. It seems that without ever naming this pattern, people
have the instinct to "open up" a room; or to give "more enclosure"
to some other space,
Therefore:
Adjust the walls, openings, and windows in each indoor
space until you reach the right balance between open, flowing
space and closed cell-like space. Do not take it for
granted that each space is a room; nor, on the other hand,
that all spaces must flow into each other. The right balance
will always lie between these extremes: no one room
entirely enclosed; and no space totally connected to another.
Use combinations of columns, half-open walls,
porches, indoor windows, sliding doors, low sills, french
doors, sitting walls, and so on, to hit the right balance.

Windows are most often used to create connections between
the indoor and the outdoors. But there are many
cases when an indoor space needs a connecting window to
another indoor space.
This is most often true for corridors and passages. These places
can easily seem deserted. People feel more connected to one
another by interior windows, and the passages in the building become
less deserted.
The same may hold for certain rooms, especially small rooms.
Three bare walls and a window can seem like a prison. Windows
placed between rooms, or between a passage and a room, will
help to solve these problems and will make both the passages and
the rooms more lively.
Furthermore, when rooms and passages are visibly connected to
one another, it is possible to grasp the overall arrangement of a
building far more clearly than in a building with blank walls between
all the rooms.
It is enough if these windows allow people to see through
them; they do not need to be open nor the kind which can be

 STAIRCASE VOLUME*

•.• STAIRCASE AS A STAGE 3 and OPEN STAIRS  will tell
you roughly where to place the various stairs, both indoors and
outdoors. This pattern gives each stair exact dimensions and treats
it like a room so that it becomes realistic in the plan.

We are putting this pattern in the language because our
experiments have shown us that lay people often make
mistakes about the volume which a staircase needs and
therefore make their plans unbuildable.
Herc are some examples of the stairs which people who arc
not used to building, draw, or think of, when they try to lay out
houses for themselves.

these plans without destroying them. In order to put m a
realistic stair, it would be necessary to rethink the plan entirely.
To avoid this kind of mental backtracking, it is essential that
stairs be more or less realistic from the very start.
The simplest way to understand a stair is this. Every staircase
occupies a volume, two stories high. lf this volume is the right
shape, and large enough to give the stair its rise, then it will be
possible to fill it later, with a stair which works.

Two-story space.
There are several possible layouts for this volume: any one of
them will work, provided that the length of run is long enough
for the slope of the stair, and the floor to floor height. We urge
you to be as free as possible when you decide the slope of the
stair. Unfortunately, the search for perfect safety in housing laws,
insurance standards, and bank policies, has exaggerated the

standardisation of slopes. For example, Federal Housing Authority
regulations specify thJt stairs should be between  and
degrees in slope. But in some cases-a very small house, a stair
to the roof-such a shallow stair is a waste of space; a steep stair
is far more appropriate. And in other cases-a main stair in a
public building, or an outdoor stair-a much shallower stair is
more generous, and more appropriate.
Therefore:
Make a two story volume to contain the stairs. It may be
straight, L-shaped, U-shaped, or C-shaped. The stair may
be  feet wide for a very steep stair or  feet wide for a
generous shallow stair. But, in all cases, the entire stairwell
must form one complete structural bay, two stories
high.
Do not assume that all stairs have to have the "standard"
angle of  degrees. The steepest stair may almost be a
ladder. The most generous stair can be as shallow as a
ramp and quite wide. As you work out the exact slope of
your stair, bear in mind the relationship: riser+ tread =
17½ inches.
Construct the staircase as a vault, within a space defined by
columns, just like every other room-COL UM NS AT THE CORNERS

CORNER DOORS*
... this pattern helps you place doors exactly. Use it to help
create the larger FLOW THROUGH ROOMS  1). You can use it
too, to generate a SEQUENCE OF SITTING SPACES  2)' by leaving
small corners for sitting, uninterrupted by the doors; and you
can use it to create TAPESTRY OF LIGHT AND DARK ), since
every door, if glazed and near a window, will create a natural
pool of light which people gravitate toward.

The success of a room depends to a great extent on the
position of the doors. If the doors create a pattern of movement
which destroys the places in the room, the room will
never allow people to be comfortable.
First there is the case of a room with a single door. In general,
it is best if this door is in a corner. When it is in the middle of a
wall, it almost always creates a pattern of movement which breaks
the room in two, destroys the center, and leaves no single area
which is large enough to use. The one common exception to this
rule is the case of a room which is rather long and narrow. In this
case it makes good sense to enter from the middle of one of the
long sides, since this creates two areas, both roughly square, and
therefore large enough to be useful. This kind of central door is
especially useful when the room has two partly separate functions,
which fall naturally into its two halves.
Rooms with one door.
Now, the case of a room with two or more doors: the individual
doors should still be in the corners for the reasons given
above. But we must now consider not only the position of the
 CORNER DOORS
individual doors, but the relation between the doors. If possible,
they should be placed more or less along the same side, so as to
leave the rest of the room untouched by movement.
More generaDy, if we draw lines which connect the doors, then
the spaces which are left uncut by these lines, should be large
enough to be useful, and should have a strong positive shape-a
triangular space left between paths of circulation will hardly ever
be used.
Rooms '1.tJithm ore titan one door.
Finally, note that this pattern does not apply to very large
rooms. In a very large room, or in a room with a big table in the
middle, the doors can be in the middle, and still create a special
formal, spacious feeling. In fact, in this case, it may even be
better to put them in the middle, just to create this feeling. But
this only works when the room is large enough to benefit fr'om it.
Therefore:
Except in very large rooms, a door only rarely makes
sense in the middle of a wall. It does in an entrance room,
for instance, because this room gets its character essentially
from the door. But in most rooms, especially small ones,
put the doors as near the corners of the room as possible.
If the room has two doors, and people move through it,
keep both doors at one end of the room.

... once the plan is accurate to the nearest  or  feet, there is
a final process in which the smallest spaces-niches, built-in seats,
counters, closets and shelves-get built to form the walls. Or of
course, you can build this pattern into an existing house. In
either case, use the pattern so that it helps to create the proper
shapes for rooms-THE SHAPE OF INDOOR SPACE  1), the
ceiling heights-ALCOVES  I ), WINDOW PLACES  I So), and
CEILING HEIGHT VARIETY  I 0), and, on the outside of the
rooms, the nooks and crannies of the BUILDING EDGE 0).

Houses with smooth hard walls made of prefabricated
panels, concrete, gypsum, steel, aluminum, or glass always
stay impersonal and dead.
In the world we live in today, newly built houses and apartments
are more and more standardized. People no longer have
a chance to make them personal and individual. A personal house
tells us about the people who live there. A child's swing hanging
in a doorway reflects the attitude of parents to their children.
A window seat overlooking a favorite bush supports a contemplative,
dreamy nature. Open counters between kitchen and living
space are specific to informal family life; small closable hatches
between the two are specific to more formal styles. An open
shelf around a room should be seen at one height to display a
collector's porcelain, best seen from above; at another height and
depth if it is to be used to support a photographer's btest pictures;
at another height again for setting down drinks in the
house of a perennial party-giver. A large enough fireplace nook,
with enough built-in scats, invites a family of six to sit together.
Each of these things gives us a sense about the people living in
the house becanse each expresses some special personal need.
And everyone needs the opportunity to adapt his surroundings
to his own way of life.
In traditional societies this personal adaptation came about
very easily. People lived in the same place for very long periods,
BUILDINGS
often for whole lifetimes. And houses were made of handprocessed
materials like wood, brick, mud, straw, plaster, which
are easily modified by hand by the inhabitants themselves. Under
these conditions, the personal character of the houses came about
almost automatically from the fact of occupancy.
However, in a modern technological society, neither of these
two conditions holds good. People move frequently, and houses
are increasingly built of factory-made, factory-finished materials,
like  x  foot sheets of finished plaster board, aluminum windows,
prefabricated baked enamel steel kitchens, glass, concrete,
steel-these materials do not lend themselves at all to the
gradual modification which personal adaptation requires. Indeed,
the processes of mass production are almost directly incompatible
with the possibility of personal adaptation.
The crux of the matter lies in the walls. Smooth hard flat
industrialized walls make it impossible for people to express their
own identity, because most of the identity of a dwelling lies in or
near its surfaces-in the  or  feet near the walls. This is
where people keep most of their belongings; this is where special
lighting fixtures are; this is where special built-in furniture is
placed; this is where the special cosy nooks and corners are that
individual family members make their own; this is where the
identifiable small-scale variation is; this is the place where people

 THICK WALLS
can most easily make changes and see the product of their own
craftsmanship.
The house will become personal only if the walls are so constructed
that each new family can leave its mark on them-they
must, in other words, invite incremental fine adjustments, so
that the variety of the inhabitants who live in it rubs off on
them. And the walls must be so constructed that these fine adjustments
are permanent-so that they do accumulate over time and
so that the stock of available dwellings becomes progressively more
and more differentiated.
All this means that the walls must be extremely deep. To
contain shelves, cabinets, displays, special lights, special surfaces,
deep window reveals, individual niches, built in seats and nooks,
the walls must be at least a foot deep; perhaps even three or four
feet deep.
And the walls must be made of some material which is inherently
structural-so that however much of it gets carved out,
the whole remains rigid and the surface remains continuous almost
no matter how much is removed or added.
Then, as time goes on, each family wilJ be able to work the
wall surfaces in a very gradual, piecemeal, incremental manner.
After a year or two of occupancy, each dwelling will begin to
show its own characteristic pattern of niches, bay windows,
breakfast nooks, seats built into the walls, shelves, closets, lighting
arrangements, sunken parts of the floor, raised parts of the ceiling.
Each house will have a memory; the characteristics and personalities
of different human individuals can be written in the
thickness of the walls; the houses will become progressively more
and more differentiated as they grow older, and the process of
personal adaptation-both by choice and by piecemeal modification-
has room to breathe. The full version of this pattern was
originally published by Christopher Alexander: "Thick Walls,"
Architectural De1ign, July I 68, pp.  -26.

I  CLOSETS BETWEEN
ROOMS*

given the layout of rooms, it is now necessary to decide
exactly where to put the built-in cupboards and closets. Use them,
especially, to help form the enclosure around a workspace-WORKSPACE
ENCLOSURE ,  ), around a dressing space-DRESSING
ROOM  ), and around the doors of rather private rooms so
that the doorway itself gets some depth-co RN ER DOOR  I 6).

The provision of storage and closets usually comes as an
afterthought.
But when they are correctly placed, they can contribute greatly to
the layout of the building.
Perhaps the most important secondary feature of storage space
is its sound insulating quality. The extra wall sections, and the
doors enclosing the closet, as well as the clothes, boxes, and so on,
that are being stored, all work to create substantial acoustical
barriers. You can take advantage of this feature of closet space by
locating all required storage areas within the walls separating
rooms rather than in exterior walls, where they cut off natural
light.
In addition, when storage is placed in the interior walls of a
room, around the doorway, the resulting thickness will make the
transitions between rooms and corridors more distinct. For the
person entering such a room, the thickness of the wall creates a
subtle "entry" space, which makes the room more private. This
way of making the closet "thickness" around an entrance is
therefore appropriate for spaces like the coUPLE's REALM  I )
and the various private rooms-A ROOM OF ONE'S OWN 1).
Closets fo,·m the entrance to the room.
I   CLOSETS BETWEEN ROOMS
Therefore:
Mark all the rooms where you want closets. Then place
the closets themselves on those interior walls which lie between
two rooms and between rooms and passages where
you need acoustic insulation. Place them so as to create
transition spaces for the doors into the rooms. On no account
put closets on exterior walls. It wastes the opportunity
for good acoustic insulation and cuts off precious light.

help create these larger patterns, and to make the kitchen as

care pbcing the counter ancl its windows.

Dark gloomy kitchens are depressing. The kitchen needs
the sun more than the other rooms, not less.
Look how beautiful the workspace in our main picture s.
Nearly the whole counter is lined with windows. The work

A gloomy kitchen.
Compare it with this gloomy kitchen. There is no natural light
on the work cotmter, the cabinets are a clutter; it is a shabby
experience to work there-to work below a cabinet, facing a
wall with artificial light in the middle of the day.
This gloomy kitchen is typical of many thousands of kitchens in
modern houses. It happens for two reasons. First, people often
place kitchens to the north, because they reserve the south for
living rooms and then put the kitchen in the left over areas.
And it happens, secondly, when the kitchen is thought of as
BUILDINGS
an "efficient" place, only meant for the mechanical cooking operations.
In many apartments, efficiency kitchens are even in positions
where they get no natural light at all. But, of course, the
arguments we have presented in FARMHOUSE KITCHEN  for
making the kitchen a living room, not merely a machine-shop,
change all this.
Therefore:
Place the main part of the kitchen counter on the south
and southeast side of the kitchen, with big windows around
it, so that sun can flood in and fill the kitchen with yellow

... within the THICK WALLS 7), especially around the
FARMHOUSE KITCHEN   and WORKSPACE ENCLOSURE  3))
but possibly throughout the building, there is a need for shelves.
This pattern helps you decide exactly where you want them
and how they shall be organized. Mary Louise Rogers first made
the pattern cxplici t for us.
Cupboards that are too deep waste valuable space, and
it always seems that what you want is behind something
else.
It is easy to think that you have good storage in a room or in
a building just because you have enough closets, cupboards, and
shelves. But the value of storage depends as much on the ease of
access as on the amount. An enormous amount of cupboard space
in a place where no one can get to it is not very useful. It is
useful when you can find the things which you have put away
at a glance.
This means, essentially, that except for BULK STORAGE ),
things should be stored on open shelves, "one deep." Then you
can see them all. It means, in effect, that you are flattening out
the total storage all over the walls-instead of having it in solid
lumps, hidden, and hard to reach.
The need for open storage is most obvious in kitchens. In
badly planned kitchens, the shelves are filled with things three or
four items deep, sometimes stacked on top of each other, and
something is always in the way of what you need. But in wellplanned
kitchens, all storage is one item deep. Shelves are one
can deep, glasses are stored one row deep, pots and pans are hung
one deep on the wall; for small jars and spices there are special
spice shelves that hold the items just one deep.
We think this property is common to all convenient storage. A
family's most prized possessions, gifts, whether for the kitchen
or any place else in the house, are hidden away when they arc
stored in cupboards and the back shelves of closets. Openly stored,
one deep, these things are beautiful around the house.

 OPEN SHELVES
Many forms of storage can be one-deep: swinging cabinets that
have shelves inside the doors; pegboards for pots and pans; tool
racks. It is even possible to create narrow open shelves in front of
windows. When things are just one deep, there is still enough
light coming in to make the window useful.
Open shelves across a window.
Therefore:
Cover the walls with narrow shelves of varying depth
but always shallow enough so that things can be placed on
them one deep-nothing hiding behind anything else.

 WAIST-HIGH SHELF
... anywhere where there are open shelves, and around any

WALLS 7), OPEN SHELVES 00).

In every house and every workplace there is a daily
"traffic" of the objects which are handled most. Unless
such things are immediately at hand, the flow of life is
awkward, full of mistakes; things are forgotten, misplaced.
The essence of this problem lies in the phrase "at hand." This
1s literally trne and needs to be interpreted as such. vVhen a
person reaches for something, his hands arc roughly at waist
height. When there are surfaces here and there, around the
rooms and passages and doors, which are at ,vaist height, they
become natural places to leave things and l;iter pick them up.
Pocket change, pictures, open books, an apple, a package, a
newspaper, the day's mail, a reminder note: these things are at
hand on a waist high shelf. When there are no such surfaces, then
things either get put away and are then forgotten and lost, or
they arc in the way and must continually be cleared aside.
Furthermore, the things that tend to collect on waist high
sheh'es become a natural, evolving kind of display of the most
ordin;iry things-the things that arc most i1rnnediatcly a part of
one's life. And since for each person these things will vary, the
waist high shelf helps a room become unique md personal, effortlessly.
Therefore:
Build waist-high shelves around at least a part of the

 BUILT-IN SEATS*
... throughout the building-SEQUENCE OF SITTING SPACES
(142)-there are alcoves, entrances, corners, and windows where
it is natural to make built-in seats-ENTRANCE ROOM  I  o), ALcovEs
( ), WINDOW PLACE   0). This pattern helps complete
them.
Built-in seats are great. Everybody loves them. They
make a building feel comfortable and luxurious. But most
often they do not actually work. They are placed wrong,
or too narrow, or the back does not slope, or the view is
wrong, or the seat is too hard. This pattern tells you what
to do to make a built-in seat that really works.
vVhy do built-in scats so often not work properJyl The reasons
are simple and fairly easy to correct. But the problem, arc critical.
If the scats are wrongly made, they just will not be used, and
they will be a waste of space, a waste of money, and a wasted
golden opportunity. What arc the critical considerations/
Position: It is natural to put the built-in seat into an unobtrusive
corner-that is where it melts most easily into the
structure and the wall. But, as a result, it is often out of the
way. If you want to build a seat, ask yourself where you would
place a sofa or a comfortable armchair-and build the seat tlzore,
not tucked into some hopeless corner.
Width and comfort: Built-in seats are often too hard, too narrow,
rnd too stiff-backed. No one wants to sit on a shelf, especially
not for any length of time. Make the seat as wide as a
really comfortable chair at least  inches), with a back that
slopes gently  not upright), and put a warm soft cushion on it
and on the back, so that it is really comfortable.
View: Most people want to look at something when they siteither
at other people or a view. Built-in seats often place you
so that you are facing away from the view or away from the other
people in the room. Place the seat so that a person sitting
down is looking at something interesting.
BUILDINGS
Therefore:
Before you build the seat, get hold of an old arm chair
or a sofa, and put it into the position where you intend to
build a seat. Move it until you really like it. Leave it there
for a few days. See if you enjoy sitting in it. Move it if
you don't. When you have got it into a position which
you like, and where you often find yourself sitting, you
know it is a good position. Now build a seat that is just
as wide, and just as well padded-and your built-in seat
will work.

 CHILD CAVES
... the places specially devoted to children's play-ADVENTURE
PLAYGROUND 3), CHILDREN'S HOME 6), CHILDREN'S REALM
(137)-and THICK WALLS 7)-can be embellished with a
special detail.

Children love to be in tiny, cave-like places.
In the course of their play, young children seek out cave-like
spaces to get into and under-old crates, under tables, in tents,
etc. For evidence see L. E. White, "The Outdoor Play of
Children Living in Flats," Living in Towns, Leo Kuper, ed.,
London, 53, pp. -64.)
ft
They try to make special places for themselves and for their
friends-most of the world about them is "adult space" and
they are trying to carve out a place that is kid size.
When children are playing in such a "cave"-each child takes
up about  square feet; furthermore, children like to do this in
groups, so the caves should be large enough to accommodate this:
these sorts of groups range in size from three to five-so I  to
  square feet, plus about I  square feet for games and circulation,
gives a rough maximum size for caves.
Therefore:

 SECRET PLACE
... and here is a finishing touch to the thick walls, perhaps
even to the low ceilings-THICK WALLS 7), CEILING HEIGHT
VARIETY  l 0),

Where can the need for concealment be expressed; the
need to hide; the need for something precious to be lost,
and then revealed?
We believe that there is a need in people to live with a secret
place in their homes: a place that is used in special ways, and
revealed only at very special moments.
To live in a home where there is such a place alters your
experience. It invites you to put something precious there, to
conceal, to let only some in on the secret and not others. It
allows you to keep something that is precious in an entirely personal
way, so that no one may ever find it, until the moment you
say to your friend, "Now I am going to show you something
special"-and tell the story behind it.
There is strong support for the reality of this need in Gaston
Bachelard's The Poetics of Space New York: The Omen Press,
1964). We quote from Chapter :
With the theme of drawers, chests, locks and wardrobes, we shall
resume contact with the unfathomable store of daydreams of intimacy.
Wardrobes with their shelves, desks with their drawers, and chests
with their false bottoms are veritable organs of the secret psychological
life. Indeed, without these "objects" and a few others in
equally high favor, om intimate life would lack a model of intimacy.
They are hybrid objects, subject objects. Like us, through
us and for us, they have a quality of intimacy ....
If we give objects the friendship they should have, we do not
open a wardrobe without a slight start. Beneath its russet wood,
a wardrobe is a very white almond. To open it, is to experience
an event of whiteness.

 SECRET PLACE
An anthology devoted to small boxes, such as chests and caskets,
would constitute an important chapter in psychology. These complex
pieces that a craftsman creates are very evident witnesses of the need
for secrecy, of an intuitive sense of hiding places. It is not merely a
matter of keeping a possession well guarded. The lock doesn't exist
that could resist absolute violence, and all locks are an invitation to
thieves. A lock is a psychological threshold.
Therefore:
Make a place in the house, perhaps only a few feet
square, which is kept locked and secret; a place which
is virtually impossible to discover-until you have been
shown where it is; a place where the archives of the house,
or other more potent secrets, might be kept.

CONSTRUCTION

At this stage, you have a complete design for an individual
building. If yoit have followed the patterns given,
you have a scheme of spaces, either marked on the
ground, with stakes, or on a piece of paper, accurate to
the nearest foot or so. You know the height of rooms,
the rough size and position of windows and doors, and
you know roughly how the roofs of the building, and
the gardens are laid out.
The next, and last part of the language, tells you how
to make a buildable building directly from this rough
scheme of spaces, and tells you how to build it, in detail.
The patterns in this last section present a physical attitude
to construction that works together with the kinds of
buildings which the second part of the pattern language
generates. These construction patterns are intended for
builders-whether professional builders, or amateur
owner-builders.
Each pattern states a principle about structure and
materials. These principles can be implemented in any
number of ways when it comes time for actual building.
We have tried to state various ways in which the principles
can be built. But, partly because these patterns are
the least developed, and partly because of the nature of
building patterns, the reader will very likely have much
to add to these patterns. For example, the actual materials
used to implement them will vary greatly from
region to region . . .
Perhaps the main thing to bear in mind, as you look
over this material, is this: Our intention in this section

CONSTRUCTION
has been to provide an alternative to the technocratic and
rigid ways of building that have become the legacy of
the machine age and modern architecture.
The way of building described here leads to buildings
that are unique and tailored to their sites. It depends on
builders taking responsibility for their work; and working
out the details of the building as they go-mocking
up entrances and windows and the dimensions of spaces,
making experiments, and building directly according to
the results.
The patterns in this section are unique in several ways.
First, the sequence of the patterns is more concrete
than in any of the earlier portions of the language. It
not only corresponds to the order in which a design
matures conceptually, in the user's mind, but also corresponds
to the actual physical order of construction.
That is, except for the first four patterns, which deal
with structural philosophy, the remaining patterns can
actually be used, in the sequence given, to build a building.
The sequence of the language corresponds almost
exactly, to the actual sequence of operations on the building
site. In addition, the patterns themselves in this section
are both more concrete, and more abstract, than any
other patterns in the language.
They are more concrete because, with each pattern, we
have always given at least one interpretation which can
be built directly. For instance, with the pattern ROOT
FOUNDATION, we have given one particular interpretation,
to show that it can be done, and also to give the
reader an immediate, and practical, buildable approach
to construction.

CONSTRUCTION
Yet at the same time, they are also more abstract. The
particular concrete formulation which we have given for
each pattern, can also be interpreted, and remade in a
thousand ways. Thus, it is also possible to take the general
idea of the pattern, the idea that the foundation
functions like a tree root, in the way that it anchors the
building in the ground-and invent a dozen entirely different
physical systems, which all work in this fundamental
way. In this sense, these patterns are more abstract
than any others in the book, since they have a
wider range of possible interpretations.
To illustrate the fact that a great variety of actual
building systems can be developed, based on these patterns,
we present three versions that we have developed,
in response to different contexts.
In Mexico: Concrete block foundations with re-bar
connectors; hollow self-aligning molded earth blocks reinforced
with bamboo for walls and columns; burlap
formed concrete beams; steep barrel vaults with earth
and asphalt covering-everything whitewashed.
In Peru: Slab floors poured integrally with wall foundations;
finished with soft baked tiles; hard wood
( diablo fuerte columns and beams; plaster on bamboo
lath acting as shear walls between columns; diagonal
wood plank ceiling/floors; bamboo lattice partitions.
In Berkeley: Concrete slab finished with colored wax;
walls of exterior skin of r x boards and interior skin of
gypboard filled with light weight concrete; box columns
made of r x boards, filled with lightweight concrete;
2-inch concrete ceiling/floor vaults formed with wood
lattice and burlap forms.

CONSTRUCTION
As you can see from these examples, we have formulated
these patterns with very careful attention to cost.
We have tried to give examples of these patterns which
use the cheapest, and most easily available, materials;
we have designed them in such a way that such buildings
can be built by lay people  who can therefore avoid the
cost of labor altogether); and we have designed it so
that the cost of labor, if done professionally, is also low.
Of the three parts of the language, this third part is
the least developed. Both the part on Towns and the
part on Buildings have been tested, one partially, the
other very thoroughly, in practice. This third part has
so far only been tested in a small number of relatively
minor buildings. That means, obviously, that this material
needs a good deal of improvement.
However, we intend, as soon as possible, to test all
these patterns thoroughly in various different buildings
-houses, public buildings, details, and additions. Once
again, as soon as we have enough examples to make it
worth reporting on them, we shall publish another volume
which describes them, and our findings.
In many ways, rough though it is, this is the most
exciting part of the language, because it is here, in these
few patterns, that we can most vividly see a building
literally grow before our eyes, under the impact of the
patterns.
The actual process of construction, in which the sequence
of their patterns creates a building, is described
in chapter  of The Tirneless Way.

Before you lay out construction details, establish a
philosophy of structure which will let the structure
grow directly from your plans and your conception
of the buildings.

 GRADUAL STIFFENING

 STRUCTURE FOLLOWS
SOCIAL SP ACES**

... if you have used the· earlier patterns in the language, your
plans arc based on subtle arrangements of social spaces. But the
beauty and subtlety of all these social spaces will be destroyed,
when you start building, unless you find a way of building which
is able to follow the social spaces without distorting or rearranging
them for engineering reasons.
This pattern gives you the beginning of such a way of building.
It is the first of the  patterns which deal specifically with
structure and construction; it is the bottleneck through which
all languages pass from the larger patterns for rooms and building
layout to the smaller ones which specify the process of construction.
It not only has its own intrinsic arguments about the relation
between social spaces and load-bearing structure-it also
contains, at the end, a list of all the connections which you need
for patterns on structure, columns, walls, floors, roofs, and all the
details of construction.
No building ever feels right to the people in it unless
the physical spaces  defined by columns, walls, and ceilings)
are congruent with the social spaces  defined by activities
and human groups).
And yet this congruence is hardly ever present in modern
construction. Most often the physical and social spaces are incongruent.
Modern construction-that is, the form of construction
most commonly practiced in the mid-twentieth centuryusually
forces social spaces into the framework of a building whose
shape is given by engineering considerations.
There are two different versions of this incongruence.
On the one hand, there are those buildings whose structural
form is very demanding indeed and actually forces the social space
to follow the shape of the construction-Buckminster Fuller
domes, hyperbolic paraboloids, tension structures arc examples.

more. In these buildings the social spaces are defined by lightweight
nonstructural partitions floating free within the "neutral"
physical structure given by the engineering. The buildings of
Mies van der Rohe and Skidmore Owings and Merrill are examples.
We shall now argue that both these kinds of incongruence
do fundamental damage-for entirely different reasons.
In the first case the structure does damage simply because it
constrains the social space and makes it different from what it
naturally wants to be. To be specific: we know from onr experiments
that people are able to use this pattern language to design
buildings for themselves; and that the plans they creite, unhampered
by other considerations, have an astonishing range of
free arrangements, always finely tuned to the details of their lives
and habits.
User's house plan.

 STRUCTURE FOLLOWS SOCIAL SPACES
Any form of construction which makes it impossible to implement
these plans and forces them into the strait jacket of an alien
geometry, simply for structural reasons, is doing social damage.
Of course, it could be argued that the structnral needs of a
building are as much a part of its nature as the social and psychological
needs of its inhabitants. This argument might perhaps,
perhaps, hold water if there were indeed no way of building
buildings which conform more exactly to the loose plans based
on activities alone.
But the next few patterns in this book make it very clear that
there do exist ·ways of building which are structurally sound
and yet perfectly congruent with social space, without any compromise
whatever. Tt is therefore clear that we may legitimately
reject any form of construction which cannot adapt itself perfectly
to the forms of space required by social action.
What of the second kind of incongruence between social space
and building form-the kind where the structure creates huge
areas of almost uninterrupted "flexible" space, punctuated by
occasional columns, and the social spaces are created inside this
framework by nonstructural partitions.
Once again, many important patterns cannot be incorporated
into the design-LIGHT ON TWO SIDES OF EVERY ROOM ), for
example simply cannot be included in a giant rectangle. But in
this type of building, there is arr additional kind of incongrnence
between social space and engineering structure which comes from
the fact that the two are virtually independent of each other.
The engineering follows its own laws, the social space follows its
laws-and they do not match.
This mismatch is perceived and felt not mere.ly as a mismatch,
but as a fundamental and disturbing incoherence in the fabric of
the building, which makes people feel uneasy and unsure of themselves
and their relation to the world. We offer four possible
explanations.
First: the spaces called for by the patterns dealing with social
and psychological needs are critical. If the spaces are not right,
the needs are not met and problems are not solved. Since these
spaces are so critical, it strnds to reason that they must be felt os
real spaces, not flimsily or haphazardly partitioned spaces, which

CONSTRUCTION
only pay lip-service to the needs people experience. For instance,
if an entrance room is created with flimsy partitions, ir will not
take hold; people won't take it seriously. Only when the most
solid elements of the building form the spaces will the spaces be
fully felt and the needs which call for the space then fully be
satisfied.
Second: a building will also seem alien unless it gives to its
users a direct and intuitive sense of its structure-how it is put
together. Buildings where the structure is hidden leave yet another
gap in people's understanding of the environment around them.
We know this is important to children and suspect it must be
important to adults too.
Third: when the social space has, as its own surrounding, the
fabric of the load-bearing structure which supports that space,
then the forces of gravity are integrated with the social forces,
and one feels the resolution of all the forces which are acting in
this one space. The experience of being in a place where the
forces are resolved together at once is completely restful and
whole. It is like sitting under an oak tree: things in nature resolve
all the forces acting on them together: they are, in this sense,
whole and balanced.
Fourth: it is a psychological fact that a space is defined by its
corners. Just as four dots define a rectangle to your eye, so four
posts or more define an imaginary space between them .
•
•
Four points make a rectangle.
This is the most fundamental way in which solids define space.
Unless the actual solids which make up the building lie at the
corners of its social spaces, they must, instead, be creating other
virtual spaces at odds with the intended ones. The building will
only be at rest psychologically if the corners of its rooms are
clearly marked and coincide, at least in the majority of cases,
with its most solid elements.

 STRUCTURE FOLLOWS SOCIAL SPACES
Therefore:
A first principle of construction: on no account allow
the engineering to dictate the building's form. Place the
load bearing elements-the columns and the walls and
floors-according to the social spaces of the building; never
modify the social spaces to conform to the engineering structure
of the building.
social spaces
You will be able to guarantee that structure follows social
spaces by placing columns at the corner of every social spaceCOLUMNS
AT THE CORNERS 12); and by building a distinct
and separate vault over each room and social spacc-FLOORCEILING
VAULTS 19).
For the principles of structure which will make it possible to
build your building according to this pattern, begin with EFFICIENT
STRUCTURE  06 ; for the class of compatible materials,
see GOOD MATERIALS  07); for the fundamentals of the process
of construction, see GRADUAL STIFFENING  08 ....

 EFFICIENT STRUCTURE*
... this pattern complements the pattern STRUCTURE FOLLOWS
SOCIAL SPACES  05). Where that pattern defines the relationship
between the social spaces and the structure, this pattern lays
down the kind of structure which is dictated by pure engineering.
As you will see, it is compatible with STRUCTURE FOLLOWS soCIAL
SPACES, and will help to create it.

Some buildings have column and beam structures; others
have load-bearing walls with slab floors; others are vaulted
structures, or domes, or tents. But which of these, or what
mixture of them, is actually the most efficient? What is the
best way to distribute materials throughout a building, so
as to enclose the space, strongly and well, with the least
amount of material?
Engineers usually say that there is no answer to this question.
According to current engineering practice it is first necessary to
make an arbitrary choice among the basic possible systems-and
only then possible to use theory and calculation to fix the size of
members within the chosen system. But, the basic choice itselfat
least according to prevailing dogma-cannot be made by theory.
To anyone with an enquiring mind, this seems quite unlikely.
That such a fundamental choice, as the choice between column
and beams systems and load-bearing wall systems and vaulted
systems, should lie purely in the realm of whim-and that the
possible myriad of mixed systems, which lie between these archetypes,
cannot even be considered-all this has more to do with
the status of available theory than with any fundamental insight.
Indeed, as we shall now try to show, the archetypal, best solution
to the problem of efficient structure in a building is one
which does lie in between the three most famous archetypes. It
is a system of load-bearing walls, supported at frequent intervals
by thickened stiffeners like columns, and floored and roofed by a
system of vaults.
We shall derive the character of the most efficient structure in

CONSTRUCTION
three steps. First, we shall define the three-dimensional character
of a typical system of rooms and spaces in a building. We
shall then define an efficient structure as the smallest cheapest
amount of stable material, placed only in the interstices between
the rooms, which can support itself and the loads which the rooms
generate. Finally, we shall obtain the details of an efficient structure.
For a similar discussion, see Christopher Alexander, "An attempt
to derive the nature of a human building system from
first principles," in Edward Allen, The Respowive House,
M.I.T. Press, 74.
I. The three-dimensional character of a typical building
based purely on the social spaces and the character
of roonis.
In order to obtain this from fundamental considerations, let us
first review the typical shape of rooms-see THE SHAPE OF INDOOR
SPACE 1)-and then go on to derive the most efficient structure
for a building made up of these kinds of rooms:
I. The boundary of any space, seen in plan, is formed by
segments which are essentially straight lines-though they need
not be perfectly straight.
 The ceiling heights of spaces vary according to their social
functions. Roughly speaking, the ceiling heights vary with floor
areas-large spaces have higher ceilings, small ones lowerCEILING
HEIGHT VARIETY  0).
 The edges of the space are essentially vertical up to head
height-that is, about  feet. Above head height, the boundaries
of the space may come in toward the space. The upper corners
between wall and ceiling of a normal room serve no function, and
it is therefore not useful to consider them as an essential part of
the space.
 Each space has a horizontal floor.
 A building then is a packing of polygonal spaces Ill which
each polygon has a beehive cross section, and a height which
varies according to its size.
If we follow the principle of STRUCTURE FOLLOWS SOCIAL
SPACES 05), we may assume that this three-dimensional array of
spaces must remain intact, and not be interrupted by structural
 EFFICIENT STRUCTURE

elements. This means that an efficient structure must be one of
the arrangements of material which occupies only the interstices
between the spaces.
We may visualize the crudest of these possible structures by
means of a simple imaginary process. Make a lump of wax for
each of the spaces which appears in the building, and construct a
three-dimensional array of these lumps of wax, leaving gaps between
all adjacent lumps. Now, take a generalized "structure
fluid," and pour it all over this arrangements of lumps, so that it
completely covers the whole thing, and fills all the gaps. Let this
fluid harden. Now dissolve out the wax lumps that represent
spaces. The stuff which remains is the most generalized building
structure.
II. The most efficient structure for a given system
of spaces.
Obviously, the imaginary structure made from the structure
fluid is not real. And besides, it is rather inefficient: it would, if
actually carried out, use a great deal of material. We must now
ask how to make a structure, similar to this imaginary one, but
one which uses the smallest amount of material. As we shall see,
this most efficient structure will be a compression stmcture, in
which bending and tension are reduced to a minimum and a
continuous structure, in which all members are rigidly connected
in such a way that each member carries at least some part of the
stresses caused by any pattern of loading.
I. A compression Jtructure. In an efficient structure, we want
every ounce of material to be working to its capacity. In more
precise terms, we want the stress distributed throughout the
materials in such a way that every cubic inch is stressed to the
same degree. This is not happening, for example, in a simple
wooden beam. The material is most stressed at the top and bottom

CONSTRUCTION
of the beam; the middle of the beam has only very low stresses,
because there is too much material there relative to the stress
distribution.
As a general rule, we may say that members which are in
bending always have uneven stress distributions and that we can
therefore only distribute stresses evenly throughout the materials
if the structure is entirely free of bending. In short, then, a
perfectly efficient structure must be free of bending.
There are two possible structures which avoid bending altogether:
pure tension structures and pure compression structures.
Although pure tension structures are theoretically interesting
and suitable for occasional special purposes, the considerations
described in GOOD MATERIALS  07 rule them out overwhelmingly
on the grounds that tension materials are hard to
obtain, and expensive, while almost all materials can resist compression.
Note especially that wood and steel, the two principle
tension materials in buildings, are both scarce, and can-on
ecological grounds-no longer be used in bulk-again, see GOOD
MATERIALS  07).
 A continuous structure. In an efficient structure, it is not
only true that individual elements have even stress distributions
in them when they are loaded. It is also true that the structure
acts as a whole.
Consider, for example, the case of a basket. The individual
strands of the basket are weak. By itself no one strand can resist
much load. But the basket is so cunningly made, that all the
strands war k together to resist even the smallest load. If you press
on one part of the basket with your finger, all the strands in the
basket-even those in the part furthest from your finger-work
together to resist the load. And of course, since the whole structure
works as one, to resist the load, no one part has, individually,
to be very strong.
This principle is particularly important in a structure like a
building, which faces a vast range of different loading conditions.
At one minute, the wind is blowing very strong in one direction;
at another moment an earthquake shakes the building; in later
years, uneven settlement redistributes dead loads because some
foundations sink lower than others; and, of course, throughout
its life the people and furniture in the building are moving
95°
 EFFICIENT STRUCTURE
all the time. If each element is to be strong enough, by itself, to
resist the maximum load it can be subjected to, it will have to
be enormous.
But when the building is continuous, like a basket, so that each
part of the building helps to carry the smallest load, then, of
course, the unpredictable nature of the loads creates no difficulties
at all. Members can be quite small, because no matter what
the loads are, the continuity of the building will distribute them
among the members as a whole, and the building will act as a
whole against them.
The continuity of a building depends on its connections:
actual continuity of material and shape. It is very hard, almost
impossible, to make continuous connections between different materials,
which transfer load as efficiently as a continuous material;
and it is therefore essential that the building be made of one
material, which is actually continuous from member to member.
And the shape of the connections between elements is vital too.
Right angles tend to create discontinuities: forces can be distributed
throughout the building only if there are diagonal fillets
wherever walls meet ceilings, walls meet walls, and columns
meet beams.
Ill. The details of an efficient structure.
If we assume now that an efficient building will be both compressive
and continuous, we can obtain the main morphological
features of its structure by direct inference.
I. I tJ ceiling;, floors, and room; mwt all be vaulted. This
follows directly. The dome or vault shape is the only shape which
works in pure compression. Floors and roofs can only be continuous
with walls, if they curve downward at their edges. And
the shape of social spaces also invites it directly-since the triangle
of space between the wall and ceiling serves no useful
purpose, it is a natural place for structural material.
Vaults.

CONSTRUCTION
 Walls must all be load-bearing. Any non load-bearing partition
evidently contradicts the principle of continuity which
says that every particle of the building is helping to resist loads.
Furthermore, columns with non load-bearing partitions between
them need shear support. The wall provides it naturally;
and the continuity of the walls, floor, and ceiling can only be
created by the action of a wall that ties them together.
Load-bearing walls.
 Walls must be stiffenetl at intervals along their length by
columnar ribs. lf a wall is to contain a given amount of material,
then the wall acts most efficiently when its material is redistributed,
nonhomogeneously, to form vertical ribs. This wall is
most efficient in resisting buckling-indeed, at most thicknesses
this kind of stiffening is actually required to let the wall act at its
full compressive capacity-see FINAL COLUMN DISTRIBUTION
(  I ). And it helps to resist horizontal loads, because the
stiffeners act as beams against the horizontal forces.
r • e •
Vei-tical stiffeners.
 Connections between walls and floors, and between walls
and walls, must all be thickened by extra material that forms a
fillet along the seam. Connections are the weakest points for continuity,
and right-angled connections are the worst. However, we
know from THE SHAPE OF INDOOR SPACE   I that we cannot
avoid rough right angles where walls meet walls; and of course,
there must be rough right angles where walls meet floors. To
counteract the effect of the right angle, it is necessary to "fill"
the angle with material. This principle is discussed under COLUMN

 GOOD MATERIALS**

... the principles of structure allow you to imagine a building
in which materials are distributed in the most efficient way,
congruent with the social spaces given by the plan-STRUCTURE
F0LL0\NS SOCIAL SPACES  05), EFFICIENT STRUCTURE  06).
But of course the structural conception is still only schematic. It
can only become firm and cogent in your mind when you know
what materials the building will be made of. This pattern helps
you settle on materials.
There is a fundamental conflict in the nature of materials
for building in industrial society.
On the one hand, an organic building requires materials which
consist of hundreds of small pieces, put together, each one of
them hand cut, each one shaped to be unique according to its
position. On the other hand, the high cost of labor, and the e:1se
of mass production, tend to create materials which are large,
identical, not cuttable or modifiable, and not adaptable to idiosyncracies
of plan. These "modern" materials tend to destroy th
organic guality of natural buildings and, indeed, to make it
impossible. In addition, modern materials ttnd to be flimsy and
hard to maintain-so that buildings deteriorate more rapidly
than in a pre-industrial society where a building can be maintained
and improved for hundreds of years by patient attention.
The central problem of materials, then, is to find a collection
of materials which are small in scale, easy to cut on site, easy to
work on site without the aid of huge and expensive machinery,
easy to vary and adapt, heavy enough to be solid, longlasting or
easy to maintain, and yet easy to build, not needing specialized
labor, not expensive in bbor, and universally obtainable and
cheap.
Furthermore, this class of good materials must be ecologically
sound: biodegradable, low in energy consumption, and not based
on depletable resources.
When we take all these requirements together, they suggest a
 GOOD MATERIALS
rather startling class of "good materials"-quite different from
the materials in common use today. The following discussion is
our attempt to begin to define this class of materials. It is certainly
incomplete; but perhaps it can help you to think through
the problem of materials more carefully.
We start with what we call "bulk matcrials"-thc materials
that occur in the greatest volume in a given building. They may
account for as much as So per cent of the total volume of materials
used in a building. Traditionally, bulk materials have
been earth, concrete, wood, brick, stone, snow .... Today the
bulk materials are essentially wood and concrete and, in the
very large buildings, steel.
When we analyze these materials strictly, according to our
criteria, we find that stone and brick meet most of the requirements,
but are often out of the question where hbor is expensi,·e,
because they are labor intensive.
Wood is excellent in many ways. Where it is available people
use it in great quantities, and where it is not available people
are trying to get hold of it. Unfortunately the forests have been
terribly managed; many have been devastated; and the price of
heavy IL1mber has skyrocketed. From today's paper: "Since the
end of federal economic controls the price of lumber has been
jumping about  percent a month and is now about   percent
above what it was a year ago." San Francisco Chronicle., February
I , 73. We shaJl therefore look upon wood as a precious
material, which should not be used as a bulk material or for
structural purposes.
Steel as a bulk material seems out of the question. We do not
need it for high buildings since they do not make social senseFOUR-
STORY LIMlT 1). And for smaller buildings it is expensive,
impossible to modify, high energy in production.
Earth is an interesting bulk material. But it is hard to stabilize,
and it makes incredibly heavy walls because it has to be so thick.
Where this is appropriate, and where the earth is available, however,
it is certainly one of the "good materials."
Regular concrete is too dense. It is heavy and hard to work.
After it sets one cannot cut into it, or nail into it. And its surface
is ugly, cold, and hard in feeling, unless covered by expensive
finishes not integral to the structure.

CONSTRUCTION
And yet concrete, in some form, is a fascinating material. It
is fluid, strong, and relatively cheap. It is available in almost every
part of the world. A University of California professor of engineering
sciences, P. Kumar Mehta, has even just recently found
a way of converting abandoned rice husks into Portland cement.
Is there any way of combining all these good qualities of concrete
and also having a material which is light in weight, easy to
work, with a pleasant finish! There is. It is possible to use a whole
range of ultra-lightweight concretes which have a density and
compressive strength very similar to that of wood. They are easy
to work with, can be nailed with ordinary nails, cut with a saw,
drilled with wood-working tools, easily repaired.
Tf' e believe that ultra-lightweight concrete is one of the most
fundamental bulk materials of the future.
To make th is as clear as possible, we shall now discuss the
range of lightweight concretes. Our experiments lead us to believe
that the best lightweight concretes, the ones most useful
for building, are those whose densities lie in the range of  to 0
pounds per cubic foot and which de,elop some  to  psi
in compression.
Oddly enough, this particular specification lies in the least
developed part of the presently available range of concretes. As
we can see from the following diagram, the so-called "structural"
concretes are usually more dense at least  pounds per cubic
foot and much stronger. The most common "lightweight"
concretes use vermiculite as an aggregate, .ire used for underflooring
and insulation, and are very light, but they do not
usually develop enough strength to be structurally useful-most

often about  psi in compression. However, a range of mixed
lightweight aggregates, containing vermiculite, perlite, pumice,
and expanded shale in different proportions, can easily generate
40- pound,  psi concretes anywhere in the world. We have
had very good luck with a mix of -2-3: cement-kylite-vermiculite.
Beyond the bulk materials, there are the materials used in
relatively smaller quantities for framework, surfaces, and finishes.
These are the "secondary" materials.
When buildings are built with manageable secondary materials,
they can be repaired with the same materials: repair becomes
continuous with the original building. And the buildings are
more apt to be repaired if it is easy to do so and if the user can
do it himself bit by bit without having to rely on skilled workers
or special equipment. With prefabricated materials this is impossible,
the materials are inherently unrepairable. When prefabricated
finish materials are damaged they must be replaced
with an entirely new component.
Take the case of a garden patio. It can be made as a continuous
concrete slab. When the ground shifts slightly underneath this
slab, the slab cracks and buckles. This is quite unrepairable for the
user. It requires that the entire slab be broken out which requires
relatively heavy-duty equipment and replaced-by professional
skilled labor. On the other hand, it would have been
possible to build the patio initially out of many small bricks,
tiles, or stones. When the ground shifts, the user is then able to
lift up the broken tiles, add some more earth, and replace the
tile-all without the aid of expensive machinery or professional
help. And if one of the tiles or bricks becomes damaged, it can
be easily replaced.
What are the good secondary materials? Wood, which we want
to avoid as a bulk material, is excellent as a secondary material
for doors, finishes, windows, furniture. Plywood, particle board,
and gypsum board can all be cut, nailed, trimmed, and are relatively
cheap. Bamboo, thatch, plaster, paper, corrugated metals,
chicken wire, canvas, cloth, vinyl, rope, slate, fiberglass, nonchlorinated
plastics are all examples of secondary materials which
do rather well against our criteria. Some are dubious ecologically
-that is, the fiberglass and the corrugated metals-but again,

CONSTRUCTION
these sheet materials need only be used in moderation, to form
and finish and trim the bulk materials.
Finally, there are some materials which our criteria exclude
entirely-either as bulk or secondary materials. They are expensive,
hard to adapt to idiosyncratic plans, they require high
energy production techniques, they are in limited reserves ....
for example: steel panels and rolled steel sections; aluminum;
hard and prestressed concrete; chlorinated foams; structural
lumber; cement plaster; immense sections of plate glass ....
And, for any optimist who thinks he can go on using steel
reinforcing bars forever-consider the following fact. Even iron,
abundant as it is all over the earth's surface, is a depletable resource.
If consumption keeps growing at its present rate of increase
(as it very well may, given the vast parts of the world not
yet using resources at American and western consumption levels),
the resources of iron will run out in 050.

Therefore:
Use only biodegradable, low energy consuming materials,
which are easy to cut and modify on site. For bulk materials
we suggest ultra-lightweight 0- lbs. concrete and
earth-based materials like tamped earth, brick, and tile. For
secondary materials, use wood planks, gypsum, plywood,
cloth, chickenwire, paper, cardboard, particle board, corrugated
iron, lime plasters, bamboo, rope, and tile.

In GRADUAL STIFFENING  08), we shall work out the way of
using these materials that goes with STRUCTURE FOLLOWS SOCIAL

(235 ....
 GRADUAL STIFFENING**
in STRUCTURE FOLLOWS SOCIAL SPACES 05 and EFFICIENT
STRUCTURE  06 we have set down the beginnings of a
philosophy, an approach, to construction. coon MATERIALS 07)
tells us something about the materials we ought to use in order
to meet human and ecological demands. Now, before we start the
practical task of making a structural layout for a building, it is
necessary to consider one more philosophical pattern: one which
defines the process of construction that will make it possible to
use the right materials and get the overall conception of the
structure right.

The fundamental philosophy behind the use of pattern
languages is that buildings should be uniquely adapted to
individual needs and sites; and that the plans of buildings
should be rather loose and fluid, in order to accommodate
these subtleties.
This requires an entirely new attitude toward the process of
construction. We may define this attitude by saying that it is
desirable to build a building in such a way that it starts out
loose and flimsy while final adaptations in plan are_ made, and
then gets stiffened gradually during the process of construction,
so that each additional act of construction makes the strncture
sounder.
To understand this philosophy properly, it is helpful to imagine
a building being made like a basket. A few strands are put in
place. They are very flimsy. Other strands are woven in. Gradually
the basket gets stiffer and stiffer. I ts final structural
strength is only reached from the cooperation of all the members,
and is not reached until the building is completely finished. In
this sense, such a process produces a building in which all parts
of it are working structurally-see EFFICIENT STRUCTURE  06).
Why does the principle of gradual stiffening seem so sensible
as a process of building/
To begin with, such a structure allows the actual building
process to be a creative act. It allows the building to be built up
CONSTRUCTION
gradually. Members can be moved around before they are firmly
in place. All those detailed design decisions which can never be
worked out in advance on paper, can be made during the building
process. And it allows you to see the space in three dimensions
as a whole, each step of the way, as more material is added.
This means that since each new material that is added in the
process must adapt perfectly to the framework that is there, each
new material must be more adaptable, more flexible, more capable
of coping with variation, than the last. Thus, though the building
as a whole goes from flimsy to strong, the actual materials that
are added go from the strongest and stiffest, to the gradually
less stiff, until finally fluid materials are added.
The essence of this process is very fundamental indeed. We
may understand it best by comparing the work of a fifty-year-old
carpenter with the work of a novice. The experienced carpenter
keeps going. He doesn't have to keep stopping, because every
action he performs, is calculated in such a way that some later
action can put it right to the extent that it is imperfect now.
What is critical here, is the sequence of events. The carpenter
never takes a step which he cannot correct later; so he can keep
working, confidently, steadily.
The novice, by comparison, spends a great deal of his time
trying to figure out what to do. He does this essentially because
he knows that an action he takes now may cause unretractable
problems a little further down the line; and if he is not careful,
he will find himself with a joint that requires the shortening of
some crucial member-at a stage when it is too late to shorten
that member. The fear of these kinds of mistakes forces him to
spend hours trying to figure ahead: and it forces him to work
as far as possible to exact drawings because they will guarantee
that he avoids these kinds of mistakes.
The difference between the novice and the master is simply
that the novice has not learnt, yet, how to do things in such a
way that he can afford to make small mistakes. The master
knows that the sequence of his actions will always allow him to
cover his mistakes a little further down the line. It is this simple
but essential knowledge which gives the work of a master carpenter
its wonderful, smooth, relaxed, and almost unconcerned
simplicity.
 GRADUAL STIFFENING
In a building we have exactly the same problem, only greatly
magnified. Essentially, most modern construction has the character
of the novice's work, not of the master's. Tl1e builders do
not know how to be relaxed, how to deal with earlier mistakes
by later detailing; they do not know the proper sequence of
events; and they do not, usually, h;ive a building system, or a
construction process, which allows them to develop this kind of
relaxed and casual wisdom. Instead, like the novice, they work
exactly to finely detailed drawings; the building is extremely
uptight as it gets made; any departure from the exact drawings
is liable to cause severe problems, may perhaps make it necessary
to pull out whole sections of the work.
This novice-like and panic-stricken attention to detail has two
very serious results. First, like the novice, the architects spend a
great deal of time trying to work things out ahead of time, not
smoothly building. Obviously, this costs money; and helps create
these machine-like "perfect" buildings. Second, a vastly more serious
consequence: the details control the whole. The beauty and
subtlety of the plan in which patterns have held free sway over
the design suddenly becomes tightened and destroyed because,
in fear that details won't work out, the det.1ils of connections, and
components, are allowed to control the pLrn. As a result, rooms
get to be slightly the wrong shape, windows go out of position,
spaces between doors and walls get altered just enough to make
them useless. In a word, the whole character of modern architecture,
namely the control of larger space by piddling details of
construction, takes over.
What is needed is the opposite-a process in which details
are fitted to the whole. This is the secret of the master carpenter;
it is described in det;iil in The Timeless Way of Built!ing as
the foundation of all organic form and all successful building.
The process of gradual stiffening, which we describe here, is the
physical and procedural embodiment of this essential principle.
We now ask how, in practice, it is possible to create a gradually
stiffened structure within the context defined by the pattern
GOOD MATERIALS 07).
Facts about materials give us the starting point we need.
r. Sheet -materials are easy to produce and make the best connections.
CONSTRUCTION
In traditional society there are few sheet materials. However,
factory production tends to make sheets more easily than other
forms of material. As we move into an age of mass production,
sheet materials become plentiful and are naturally strong, light,
and cheap. Gypsum board, plywood, cloth, vinyl, canvas, fiberglass,
particle board, wood planks, corrugated metals, chicken wire, are
all examples.
And sheet materials are the strongest for connections. Connections
are the weak points in a structure. Sheet materials are
easy to connect, because connections can join surfaces to one
another. Anything made out of sheets is inherently stronger than
something made of lumps or sticks.
 U lira-lightweight concrete is an excellent fill materialit
has the density of wood, is strong, light, easy to cut, easy to
repair, easy to nail into-anrl is available everywhere. This is
discussed fully in Goon MATERIALS  07).
 However, any kind of concrete needs formwork: and the
cost off ormwork is enormous.
This makes it very expensive indeed to build any complex
form; and within conventional building systems, it more or less
rules out the kind of "organic" structure which we have described.
Furthermore, in regular concrete work, the formwork is eventually
wasted, thrown away.
We believe that the finishes in any sensible building system
should be integral with the process of construction and the structure
itself as they are in almost all traditional buildings)and
that any building system in which finishes have to be
"a.dded" to the building are wasteful, and unnatural.
 We therefore propose that ultra-lightweight concrete be
poured into farms which are made of the easily available sheet
materials: and that these materials are then left in place to form
the finish.
The sheet materials can be any combination of cloth, canvas,
wood planks, gypsum boards, fiberboards, plywood, paper, plastered
chickenwire, corrugated metals, and where it is possible, tile,
brick, or stone-see GOOD MATERIALS 07). For the ultra-lightweight
concrete we recommend a perlite, expanded shale, or
pumice aggregate. Tamped earth, adobe, nonchlorinated foams,
may also do instead of the concrete, if loads allow it.

 GRADUAL STIFFENING

One version of gradual stiffening, using one incl, planks,
gypsum board and burlap as sheets, with ultra-lightweight
concrete as fill.
The drawing above, shows one particular realisation of this
kind of gradual stiffening. But the principle is far more general
than this particular use of it. Indeed, it occurs, in one way or
another, in almost all traditional forms of building. Eskimo igloo
construction and African basket structures are both gradually
stiffened structures, where each next step copes with the existing
framework, adds to it, and stiffens it. The stone buildings of
Alberobello in southern Italy are examples. So is Elizabethan halftimber
construction.
CONSTRUCTION
Therefore:
Recognize that you are not assembling a building from
components like an erector set, but that you are instead
weaving a structure which starts out globally complete, but
flimsy; then gradually making it stiffer but still rather
flimsy; and only finally making it completely stiff and
strong.
We believe that in our own time, the most natural version
of this process is to put up a shell of sheet materials, and
then make it fully strong by filling it with a compressive
fill.
soft skin formwork compressive fill

Choose the most natural materials you can, for the outer shell
itself-thin wood planks for columns, canvas or burlap for the
vaults, plaster board or plank or bricks or hollow tiles for wallscooD
MATERIALS 07).
Use ultra-lightweight  to  pounds perlite concrete for the
compressive fill-it has the same density as wood and can be cut
and nailed like wood, both during the construction and in later
years when repairs become necessary-Goon MATERIALS  07).
Build up the columns first, then fill them with the ultralightweight
concrete; then build up the beams and fill them;
then the vaults, and cover them with a thin coat of concrete
which hardens to form a shell; then fill that shell with even
lighter weight materials to form the floors; then make the walls
and window frames, and fill them; and finally, the roof, again a

within this philosophy of structure, on the basis of
the plans which you have made, work out the

do on paper, before you actually start to build;

... assume now that you have a rough plan, to scale, for each
floor of the building. In this case you already know roughly how
the roofs will go, from CASCADEO F ROOFS( 16 and SHELT ER!NG
ROOF  I ); and you know exactly where the roof is flat to form
roof gardens next to rooms at different floors-ROOF GARDEN
( I  ). This pattern shows you how to get a detailed roof plan
for the building, which helps those patterns come to life, for any
plan which you have drawn.

What kind of roof plan is organically related to the nature
of your building?
We know, from arguments presented in THE SHAPE oF INDOOR
SPACE 1), that the majority of spaces in an organic building
will have roughly-not necessarily perfectly-straight walls because
it is only then that the space on both sides of the walls
can be positive, or convex in shape.
And we know, from similar arguments, that the majority of
the angles in the building will be roughly-again, not exactlyright
angles, that is, in the general range of  to r oo degrees.
We know, therefore, that the class of natural plans may contain
a variety of shapes like half circles, octagons, and so on-but
that for the most part, it will be made of very rough, sloppy
rectangles.
We also know, from SHELTERING ROOF II ), that entire
wings should be under one roof whenever possible and that the
building is to be roofed with a mixture of flat roofs and sloping
or domical roofs, with the accent on those which are not flat.
We may therefore state the problem of defining a roof layout
as follows: Given an arbitrary plan of the type described above,
how can we fit to it an arrangement of roofs which conforms to
the CASCADE OF ROOFS r r6 and SHELTER!NG ROOF n7 and
ROOF GARDENS JI )?
Before explaining the procedure for laying out roofs in detail,
we underline live assumptions which provide the basis for the
procedure.

CONSTRUCTION
r. The "pitched" roofs may actually be pitched, or they may
be vaults with a curved pitch, or barrel vaults-as described in
ROOF VAULTS 20). The general procedure, in all three cases,
is the same. For cmved vaults, define slope as height-to-width
ratio.)
Ll
T lie "pitch" of a vaulted roof.
 Assume that all roofs in the building, which are not flat,
have roughly the same slope. For a given climate and roof construction,
one slope is usually best; and this greatly simplifies
constrnction.
The same slope t!troug!tout.
 Since all roofs have the same slope, the roofs which cover
the widest wings and/ or rooms will have the highest peaks;
those covering smaller wings and rooms will be relatively lower.
This is consistent with MAIN BUILDING 9), CASCADE OF ROOFS
(r ), and CEILING HEIGHT VARIETY 0).
Wide roofs are !tig!test.
 Any place where the building helps to enclose an outdoor
room or courtyard needs an even eave line so that it has the
space of a "room." An irregular roof line, with gable ends, will
usually destroy the space of a small courtyard. It is necessary,
therefore, that roofs be hipped in these positions to make the
roof edge horizontal.

CONSTRUCTION
We shall now discuss the rules for roofing a building by using
an example of a house designed by a layman using the pattern
language. This building plan is shown below. It is a single-story
house and it contains no roof gardens or balconies.
We first identify the largest rectangular cluster of rooms and
roof it with a peaked roof, the ridge line of which runs the
long direction:
Then we do the same with smaller clusters, until all the major
spaces are roofed.
Then we roof remaining small rooms, alcoves, and thick walls
with shed roofs sloping outward. These roofs should spring from
the base of the main roofs to help relieve them of outward
thrusts; their outside walls should be as low as possible.

 ROOF LAYOUT
Finally, we identify the outdoor spaces shown as A, B, and
C), and hip the roofs around them to preserve a more continuous
eave line around the spaces.
We shall now discuss a slightly more complicated example, a
two story building.
We begin with the top story, roofing the entire master bedroom
and bath under one peaked roof with the ridge running
lengthwise:
Next we move to the lower story, roofing the children's wing
under a flat roof to form a ROOF GARDEN II  for the master
bedroom, and the larger living room under a pitched roof, again
with the ridge running lengthwise.

CONSTRUCTION
Then we bring the roof over the master bedroom down over
the interior loft.
Finally, we smooth the living room roof ridge line into the
side of the roof over the loft. This completes the roof layout.
It is very helpful, when you are laying out roofs, to remember
the structural principle outlined in CASCADE OF ROOFS 16).
When you have finished, the overall arrangement of the roofs
should form a self-buttressing cascade in which each lower roof
helps to take up the horizonal thrust generated by the higher
roofs-and the overall section of the roofs, taken in very very
general terms, tends toward a rough upside down catenary.
Therefore:
Arrange the roofs so that each distinct roof corresponds
to an identifiable social entity in the building or building
complex. Place the largest roofs-those which are highest
and have the largest span-over the largest and most important
and most communal spaces; build the lesser roofs
off these largest and highest roofs; and build the smallest
roofs of all off these lesser roofs, in the form of half-vaults
and sheds over alcoves and thick walls.

You can build all these roofs, and the connections between
them, by following the instructions for roof vaults-ROOF VAULT s
(  zo). When a wing ends in the open, leave the gable end at
full height; when a wing ends in a courtyard, hip the gable, so
that the horizontal roof edge makes the courtyard like a roomCOURTYARDWS
HICHL IVE   ).
Treat the smallest shed roofs, which cover thick walls and
alcoves, as buttresses, and build them to help take the horizontal
thrust from floor vaults ;111d higher roof vaults-THICKENING THE
OUTER WALLS   JI . ...

 IO FLOOR AND CEILING
LAYOUT
... EFFICIENT STRUCTURE  06 tells us that the spaces in the
building should be vaulted so that the floors and ceilings can be
made almost entirely of compression materials. To lay out the
floor and ceiling vaults, we must fit them to the variety of ceiling
heights over individual rooms-CEILING HEIGHT VARIETY  I 0)
and, on the top story, to the layout of the roof vaults-ROOF
LAYOUT 09).

Again, the basic problem is to maintain the integrity of
the social spaces in the plan.
We know, from STRUCTURE FOLLOWS SOCIAL SPACES   )'
that floor and ceiling vaults must correspond to the important
social spaces in the plan. But there are a great number of social
spaces, and they range in size from spaces like WINDOW PLACE
(180), perhaps five feet across, to spaces like FARMHOUSE KITCHEN
( ), perhaps I  feet across, to collections of spaces, like COMMON
AREAS AT THE HEART  I )' perhaps   feet across.
Where vaults of different width are near each other, you
must remember to pay attention to the level of the floor above.
Either you can level out the floor by making the smaller vaults
have proportionately higher arches, or you can put extra material
in between to keep the small vaults low-see CEILING
HEIGHT VARIETY  0), or you can make steps in the floor above
to correspond to changes in the vault sizes below.
Vaults on different floors do not have to line up perfectly with
one another. In this sense they are far more flexible than
column-beam structures, and for this reason also better adapted
to STRUCTURE FOLLOWS SOCIAL SPACES  05). However' there
are limits. If one vault is placed so that its loads come down over

 FLOOR AND CEILING LAYOUT
the arch of the vault below, this will put undue stress on the
lower vault. Instead, we make use of the fact that vertical forces,
passing through a continuous compressive medium, spread out
downward in a  degree angle cone. If the lower columns are
always within this cone, the upper vault will do no structural
damage to the vault below it.
T /,e angle at w!tich a vertical force spreads dMvnward.
To maintain reasonable structural integrity in the system of
vaults as a whole, we therefore suggest that every vault be placed
so that its loads come down in a position from which the forces
can go to the columns which support the next vault down, by
following a  degree diagonal.

With all this in mind then, work out a vault plan for your
building. We suggest that you try to keep the vaults aligned with
the rooms, with occasional adjustments to suit a very big room,
or a very small nook or alcove. The drawing on the next page
shows a floor and ceiling layout for a simple building.
Each space that you single out for a vault may have either a
two-way vault a domical ceiling on a rectangular base or a
one-way vault a barrel vault). The two-way vaults are the most
efficient structurally; but when a space is long and narrow, the
domical shape begins to act like a barrel vault. We therefore

suggest domical vaults for spaces where the long side is not more
than twice the short side and barrel vaults for the spaces which
are narrower.
We also suggest that you use barrel vaults for the rooms immediately
under the roof. The roof itself is generally a barrel vaultsee
ROOF VAULT 20)-so it is most natural to give the ceiling
of the space just under the roof a barrel vault as well.
The vaults described in FLOOR-CEILING VAULTS 19 may

span from  to  feet. And they require a rise of at least I
per cent of the short span.
Therefore:
Draw a vault plan, for every floor. Use two-way vaults
most often; and one-way barrel vaults for any spaces which
are more than twice as long as they are wide. Draw sections
through the building as you plan the vaults, and bear
the following facts in mind:
r. Generally speaking, the vaults should correspond to
rooms.
 There will have to be a support under the sides of
each vault: this will usually be the top of a wall. Under
exceptional circumstances, it can be a beam or arch.
 A vault may span as little as  feet and as much as 0
feet. However, it must have a rise equal to at least  per
cent of its shorter span.
 If the edge of one vault is more than a couple of feet
(in plan from the edge of the vault below it-then the
lower vault will have to contain an arch to support the load
from the upper vault.

... the arrangement of roof and floor vaults will generate horizontal
outward thrust, which needs to be buttressed-CASCADE OF
ROOFS 16). It also happens, that in a sensibly made building
every floor is surrounded, at various places, by small alcoves,
window seats, niches, and counters which form "thick walls"
around the outside edge of rooms-WINDOW PLACE  0),
THICK WALLS 7), SUNNY COUNTER 9), BUILT-IN SEATS
(202), CHILD CAVES 03), SECRET PLACE 04). The beauty
of a natural building is that these thick walls-since they need
lower ceilings, always, than the rooms they come from-can
work as bu !tresses.
Once the ROOF LAYOUT 09), and the FLOOR AND CEILING
LAYOUT  are clear these thick walls can be laid out in such
a way as to form the most effective butresses, against the horizontal
thrust developed by the vaults.

We have established in THICK WALLS 7), how important
it is for the walls of a building to have "depth" and
"volume," so that character accumulates in them, with time.
But when it comes to laying out a building and constructing
it, this turns out to be quite hard to do.
The walls will not usually be thick in the literal sense, except in
certain special cases where mud construction, for example, lends
itself to the making of walls. More often, the thickness of the wall
has to be built up from foam, plaster, columns, struts, and membranes.
In this case columns, above all, play the major role, because
they do the most to encourage people to develop the walJs.
For instance, if the framework of a wall is made of columns
standing away from the back face of the wall, then the wall
invites modification-it becomes natural and easy to nail planks
to the columns, and so make seats, and shelves, and changes
there. But a pure, flat, blank wall does not give this kind of encouragement.
Even though, theoretically, a person can always add
things which stick out from the wall, the very smoothness of the
 I I THICKENING THE OUTER WALLS
wall makes it much less likely to happen. Let us assume then, that
a thick wall becomes effective when it s a volume defined by
columns.
Thick walls made effective by columns.
How is it possible for a wall of this kind to justify its expense
by helping the structure of the building/ The fact that the
building is conceived as a compressive structure, whose floors
and roofs are vaults-EFFICIENT STRUCTURE  06), means that
there are horizontal thrusts developed on the outside of the building,
where the vaults do not counterbalance one another.
To some extent this horizontal thrust can be avoided by arranging
the overall shape of the building as an upside down
catenary-see CASCADEO F ROOFS( 16). If it were a perfect catenary,
there would be no outward thrust at all. Obviously, though,
most buildings are narrower and steeper than the ideal structural
catenary, so there are h'.lrizontal thrusts remaining. Although
these thrusts can be resolved by tensile reinforcing in the perimeter
beams-see PERIMETER BEAMS  I )-it is simplest, and most
natural, and stable to use the building itself to buttress the horizon
ta! thrusts.
This possibility occurs naturally wherever there are "thick
walls"-alcoves, window seats, or any other small spaces at the
outside edge of rooms, which can have lower ceilings than the
main room and can therefore have their roofs shaped as continuations
of the ceiling vault inside. This requires that thick walls be
outside the structure of the main room, so that their roofs and
walls come close to forming a catenary with the main vault.
A !coves within the catenary.
CONSTRUCTION
It is of course rare to be able to have the alcove or thick walls
approach a true catenary section-we hardly ever want them that
deep or that low. But even when the thick walls and alcoves are
inside the line of the catenary, they are still helping to counter
outward thrusts. And their buttressing effect can be improved
still more by making their roofs heavy. The extra weight will
tend to redirect the forces coming from the main vault
slightly more toward the ground.
The drawing below shows the way this pattern works, and
the kind of effect it has on a building.

Therefore:
Mark all those places in the plan where seats and closets
are to be. These places are given individually by ALCOVES
(179), WINDOW PLACES 0), THICK WALLS 7), SUNNY
COUNTER 9), WAIST-HIGH SHELF 01), BUILT-IN SEATS
(202), and so on. Lay out a wide swath on the plan to correspond
to these positions. Make it two or three feet deep;
recognize that it will be outside the main space of the room;
your seats, niches, shelves, will feel attached to the main
space of rooms but not inside them. Then, when you lay
out columns and minor columns, place the columns in
such a way that they surround and define these thick volumes
of wall, as if they were rooms or alcoves.
For shelves and counters less than  feet deep, there is no
need to go to these lengths. The thickening can be built
simply by deepening columns and placing shelves between
them.

social spaces, becomes a recognizable part of che building structure-

... assume that you have worked out the roof plan, and laid out
ceiling vaults for every room on every floor-ROOF LAYOUT
(209), FLOOR AND CEILING LAYOUT ). These vaults are not
only the basis of the structure, but also define the social spaces
underneath them. Now it is time to put columns at the corners
of the vaults. This will both complete them as clearly defined
social spaces-STRUCTURE FOLLOWS SOCIAL SPACES   )-and
also be the first constructive step in the erection of the building
-GRADUAL STIFFENING 08).
We have already established the idea that the structural
components of a building should be congruent with
its social spaces.
In STRUCTURE FOLLOWS SOCIAL SPACES 05 we have established
that the columns need to be at corners of social spaces for
psychological reasons. In EFFICIENT STRUCTURE 06 we have
established that there needs to be a thickening of material at
the corners of a space for purely structural reasons.
Now we give yet a third still different derivation of the same
pattern-not based on psychological arguments or structural arguments,
but on the process by which a person can communicate a
complex design to the builder, and ensure that it can be built
in an organic manner.
We begin with the problem of measurement and working
drawings. For the last few decades it has been common practice
to specify a building plan by means of working drawings. These
measured drawings are then taken to the site; the builder
transfers the measurements to the site, and every detail of the
drawings is built in the flesh, on site.
This process cripples buildings. It is not possible to make
such a drawing without a T-square. The necessities of the drawing
itself change the plan, make it more rigid, turn it into the
kind of plan which can be drawn and can be measured.
But the kind of plans which you can make by using the pattern

 I  COLUMNS AT THE CORNERS
language are much freer than that-and not so easy to draw and
measure. Whether you conceive these plans out on the site-and
mark them on the site with sticks and stones and chalk marksor
draw them roughly on the back of envelopes or scraps of
tracing paper-in all events, the richness which you want to
build into the plan can only be preserved if the builder is able to
generate a living building, with all its slightly uneven lines and
imperfect angles.
Chalk marks on the ground.
In order to achieve this aim, the building must be generated
in an entirely different manner. It cannot be made by following
a working drawing slavishly. What must be done, essentially, is to
fix those points which generate the spaces-as few of them as
possible-and then let these points generate the walls, right out
on the building site, during the very process of construction.
You may proceed like this: first fix the corner of every major
space by putting a stake in the ground. There are no more than
a few dozen of these corners in a building, so th is is possible,
even if the measurements are intricate and irregular. Place these
corner markers where they seem right, without regard for the

CONSTRUCTION
exact distances between them. There is no reason whatever to
try and make modular distances between them. If angles are
slightly off, as they often will be, the modular dimensions are
impossible anyway.

"Staking out"
These simple marks are all you need to build the building.
Once construction starts, you can start very simply, by building
a column, over each of these marks. These columns will then
generate the rest of the building, by their mere presence, without

 COLUMNS AT THE CORNERS
any further need for detailed measurements or drawings, because
the walls will simply be built along the lines which connect adjacent
colnmns: and everything else follows.
For the upper storys, you can make drawings of the column
positions and once again transfer them to the actual building
while it is being built. As you will see from FINAL COLUMN
DISTRIBUTION   I ), upper story columns do not need to line
up perfectly with downstairs columns.
With this procedure, it becomes possible to transfer a rather
complex building from your mind, or from a scrap of paper, to
the site-and regenerate it in a way which makes it live out
there.
The method hinges on the fact that you can fix the corners
of the spaces lirst-,rnd that these corners may then play a
significant role in the construction of the bnilding. It is interesting
that althongh it is based on entirely different arguments
from STRUCTURE FOLLOWS SOCIAL SPACES 05), it leads to almost
exactly the same conclnsion.
Therefore:
On your rough building plan, draw a dot to represent
a column at the corner of every room and in the corners
formed by lesser spaces like thick walls and alcoves. Then
transfer these dots onto the ground out on the site with
stakes.
columns at corners
Once you have the columns for each floor on your vault plan,
reconcile them from floor to floor and put in intermediate col-

umns-FINAL COLUMN DJSTRIBUTJON   l ). Note, especially,
that it is not necessary for the corner columns to fall on a grid.
The floor vaults and roof vaults can be made to fit any arrangement
of columns, and still make a coherent structure-thus allowing
the social spaces to determine the building shape without
undue constraint from purely structural considerations-FLOORCEILING
VAULTS 19), ROOF VAULTS 20).
These columns will not only guide your mental image of the
building, they will also guide construction: first put the columns
and the column foundations in place; then, to make the frame
complete, tie the columns together around each room with the
perimeter beam-ROOT FOUNDATIONS 14), BOX COLUMNS
(  l ), PERIMETER BEAMS   ). Give special emphasis to all
free-standing columns with the idea that when you build them,
you will make them very thick-COLUMN PLACE  26 .•..

 I  FINAL COLUMN
DISTRIBUTION**

... assume that you have placed the corner columns which
define the spaces-COLUMNS AT THE CORNERS   I ). It is now
necessary to fill in the gaps between the columns with intcnnecli.itc
stiffener columns as required by EFFICIENT STRUCTURE  06).
This pattern gives the spacing of these intermediate stiffener
columns, and helps to generate the kind of walls which EFFICIENT
STRUCTURE 06 requires. It also helps to generate
CEILING HEIGHT VARIETY 0).
How should the spacing of the secondary columns which
stiffen the walls, vary with ceiling height, number of stories
and the size of rooms?
In some very gross intuitive way we know the answer to this
question. Roughly, if we imagine a building with the walls
stiffened at intervals along their length, we can see that the texture
of these stiffeners needs to be largest near the ground,
where social spaces are largest and where loads are largest, and
smallest near the roof, where rooms are smallest and where loads
are least. In its gross intuitive form this is the same as the intuition
which tells us to expect the finest texture in the ribbing at
the fine end of a leaf where everything is smallest, and to expect
the grosser, cruder structure to be near the large p:irt of the leaf.
Leaf.
 I J FINAL COLUMN DISTRIBUTION
These intuitions are borne out by many traditional building
forms where columns, or frames, or stiffeners are larger and
furtl1er apart near the ground, ,rnd liner and closer together
higher up. Our key picture shows examples. But what is the
structLual basis for these intuitions I
Elastic plate theory gives us a formal explanation.
Consider an unstiffcned thin wall carrying an axial load. This
wall will usually foil in buckling before it fails in pure compression
because it is thin. And this means that the material in the wall
is not being used efficiently. It is not able to carry the compressive
loads which its compressive strength makes possible becn1se it is
too thin.
It is therefore natural to design a wall which is either thick
enough or stiffened enough so that it can carry loads up to its
full compressive capacity without buckling. Such a wall, which
uses its material to the limits of its compressive capacity, will then
also satisfy the demands of EFFICIENT STRUCTURE  06).
The critical factor is the slenderness of the wall: the ratio of
its height to its thickness. For the simple case of an unstiffened
concrete wall, the ACI code tells us that the wall will be able to
work at  per cent efticiency th. is, carry  per cent of its
potential compressive load without buckling), i( it has a slenderness
ratio of IO or less. A wall IO feet high ,md I foot thick is
therefore eflicienc in this sense.
Suppose now, that we extrapolate to the case of a stiffened wall
using elastic plate theory. By using the equation which relates
alJowable stress to the spacing of stiffeners, we can obtain similar
figures for various walls with stiffeners. These figures are presented
in the curve below. For example, a wall with a slenderness
of  needs stiffeners at 0.5H apart where H is the
height thus creating panels half: as wide as they are high. In
general, obviously, the thinner the wall is, in relation to its
height, the more often it needs to be stiffened along its length.
In every case, the curve gives the spacing of stiffeners which
is needed to make the wall work at  per cent of its compressive
strength. In short, we may say that a wall built according to
the principle of EFFICIENT STRUCTURE 06 ought to be
stiffened in accordance with th is curve.

directly from this curve. We may see this m the following
manner. The walls in a four story building carry loads which
are very roughly in the ratio : :2: only very roughly). In
any case, the loads the walls carry get less and less the higher we
go in the building. If all the walls arc reaching their full compressive
capacity, this means that they must be getting steadily
thinner too, the higher one goes in the building. If we assume
that the walls all have the same height, then the four walls will
therefore have progressively greater and greater slenderness
ratios, and will therefore fall further and further to the left on
the curve, and will therefore neerl to ue stiffened at clo1er and
closer intervals.
For example, suppose a four story building l1as  foot high
walls on all floors and has wall th icknesscs of I  inches,  inches,
 inches, and  inches on its four floors. The slenderness ratios
are , I I, , and  In this case, reading off the curve, we
find the ground floor has no stiffeners at all they are infinitely
far a part), the sccon d floor has stiffeners at about  feet a part,
the third floor has them about  feet apart, and the top floor
has them about  feet apart.
In another case, where the walls are thinner because materials
are lighter and loads smaller), the spacing will be closer. Suppose,
for example, that the necessary wall thicknesses are , , , and
 I J FINAL COLUMN DISTRIBUTION
 inches. Then the slenderness ratios are I , , , and ,
and the stiffeners need to be spaced closer together than before:
nine feet apart on the ground story,  feet apart on the second
story,  feet apart on the third, and r  inches apart on the top.
As you can see from these examples, the variation in column
spacing is surprisingly great; greater, in fact, than intuition would
allow. But the variation is so extreme because we have assumed
that ceiling heights are the same on every floor. In fact, in a
correctly designed building, the ceiling height will vary from
floor to floor; and under these circumstances, as we shall see, the
variation in column spacing becomes more reasonable. There are
two reasons why the ceiling height needs to vary from floor to
floor, one social and one structural.
In most buildings, the spaces and rooms on the first floor will
tend to be larger-since communal rooms, meeting rooms, and
so on, are generally better located near the entrance to buildings,
while private and smaller rooms will be on upper stories, deeper
into the building. Since the ceiling heights vary with the size of
social spaces-see CEILING HEIGHT VARIETY  I  )-this means
that the ceiling heights are higher on the ground floor, getting
lower as one goes up. And the roof floor has either very short
walls or no wall at all-see SHELTERING ROOF II ).

!n• .,_,,...111
I
Variation of room sizes.
And there is a second, purely structural explanation of the
fact that ceilings need to be lower on upper stories. It is embodied
in the drawing of the granary shown below. Suppose that a system
of columns is calculated for pure structure. The columns on
upper stories will be thinner, because they carry less load than

CONSTRUCTION
those on lower stories. But because they are thinner, they have
less capacity to resist buckling, and must therefore be shorter if
we are to avoid wasting material. As a result, even in a granary,
where there are no social reasons for variation in ceiling height,
purely structural considerations create the n cessity for thick columns
and high ceilings on the lower stories and for thinner and
thinner columns and lower and lower ceilings the higher one gets
in the building.

German granary.
The same conclusion comes from consideration of our curve.
We have used the curve, so far, to tell us that stiffeners need
to be closer together on upper stories, because the walls are more
slender. We may also use the curve to tell us that, for a given
load, we should try to keep the slenderness ratio as low as possible.
On the upper stories, where walls are most apt to be thin, we
should therefore make the walls as low s possible, in order to
keep the slenderness ratios low.

 I J FINAL COLUMN DISTRIBUTION
Let us assume now, that the wall heights do vary in a building,
in a manner consistent with these arguments. A four story
building, with an attic story on top, might then have these wall
heights remember that the vault height, in a vaulted room, is
higher than the wall height):  feet on the ground floor,  feet
on the second,  feet on the third, and  feet on the fourth,
where the pitched roof comes down low over the eaves. And let
us assume that the wall thicknesses are I  inches,  inches,
inches, and  inches, respectively. In this case, the slenderness
ratios will be , , , . The ground floor needs no stiffeners
at all; the second has them  feet apart; the third has them
feet apart; and the fourth has them  feet apart. We show a
similar distribution in the drawing opposite.
When you try to apply this pattern to floor plan, you will find
a certain type of difficulty. Since the corners of rooms may already
be fixed by COLUMNS AT THE CORNERS  12), it is not always
possible to space the stiffeners correctly within the wall of any
given room. Naturally this does not matter a great deal; the
stiffeners only need to be about right; the spacing can comfortably
vary from room to room to fit the dimensions of the
walls. However, on the whole, you must try and put the stiffeners
closer together where the rooms are small and further apart where
rooms are large. If you do not, the building will seem odd, because
it defies one's structural intuitions.
Consider two rooms on the same floor, one twice as large as the
other. The larger room has twice the perimeter, but its ceiling
generates four times the load; it therefore carries a greater load
per unit length of wall. In an ideal efficient structure, this means
that the wall must be thicker; and therefore, by the arguments
already given, it will need stiffeners spaced further apart than the
smaller room which carries less load and has thinner walls.
We recognize that few builders will take the trouble to make
wall thicknesses vary from room to room on one floor of the
building. However, even if the wall is uniformly thick, we believe
that the stiffeners must at least not contradict this rule. If,
for reasons of layout, it is necessary that the spacing of stiffeners
varies from room to room, then it is essential that the larger
spacings of the stiffeners fall on those walls which enclose the

larger rooms. If the greater spacing of stiffeners were to coincide
with smaller rooms, the eye would be so deceived that people
might misunderstand the building.
One important note. All of the preceding analysis is based on
the assumption that walls and stiffeners are behaving as elastic
plates. This is roughly true, and helps to explain the general
!002
 I J FINAL COLUMN DISTRIBUTION
phenomenon we are trying to describe. However, no wall behaves
perfectly as an elastic plate-least of all the kind of lightweight
concrete walls we are advocating in the rest of the construction
patterns. We have therefore used a modified form of the elastic
plate theory, calibrated according to the ACI code, so that the
numbers in our analysis are based on the elastic behavior of
concrete and fall within the limits of its tension and compression).
However, when the plate goes out of the elastic range and
cracks, as it almost certainly will in a concrete design, other
factors will enter in. We therefore caution the reader most
strongly not to take the actual numbers presented in our analysis
as more than illustrations. The numbers reflect the general mathematical
behavior of such a system, but they are not reliable
enough to use in structural computations.
Therefore:
Make column stiffeners furthest apart on the ground
floor and closer and closer together as you go higher in
the building. The exact column spacings for a particular
building will depend on heights and loads and wall thicknesses.
The numbers in the following table are for illustration
only, but they show roughly what is needed.

To the extent consistent with CEILING HEIGHT VARIETY  I 0),
make walls and columns progressively shorter the higher you go
in the building to keep slenderness ratios low.
And make wall thicknesses and column thicknesses vary with
the height-see WALL MEMBRANE    ). Our calculations, for a
typical lightweight concrete building of the kind we have been
discussing, suggest the following orders of magnitude for wall
thicknesses: Top story- inches thick; one below top story-3
inches; two below top story- inches; three storys below top
(ground floor on a four story building)- inches. Of course
these numbers will change for different loads, or for different
materials, but they show the type of variation you can expect.
Column thicknesses must be proportional to wall thicknesses,
so that the thinnest walls have the thinnest columns. If they are
very thin, it will be possible to make them simply by placing
boards, or one thickness of material, outside the outer skins which
form the wall membrane-see WALL MEMBRANE 18). If the
walls are thick, they will need to be full columns, twice as
thick as the walls, and roughly square in section, built before the
walls, but made in such a way that they can be poured integrally
with the walls-Box COLUMNS 16 ....

(213)-you are ready to start the site work itself. First, stake out
the positions of the ground floor columns, before you do any
other earthwork, so that you can move the columns whenever
necessary to leave rocks or plan ts in tact-SITE REPAIR  I 04),
CONNECTION TO THE EARTH  ). Then dig the foundation
pits and prepare to make the foundations.
+ + ❖
The best foundations of all are the kinds of foundations
which a tree has-where the entire structure of the tree
simply continues below ground level, and creates a system
entirely integral with the ground, in tension and compression.
When the column and the foundations are separate elements
which have to be connected, the connection becomes a difficult
and critical joint. Both bending and shear stresses are extremely
high just at the joint. If a connector is introduced as a third
element, there are even more joints to worry about, and each
member works Jess effectively to resist these stresses.
We suspect that it would be better to build the foundations
and the columns in such a way that the columns get rooted in
the foundation and become integral and continuous with the
ground.
In the realization of this pattern which we illustrate, the root
foundation takes a very simple form. Since columns start out
hollow, BOX COLUMNS 16), we can form a root foundation by
setting the hollow column into the foundation pit, and then
pouring the lower part of the column and the foundation, integrally,
in a single pour.
As far as the wood version is concerned, the problem of placing

The wood of the column can be protected from dry rot and termites
by pressure dipping in pentachlorophenol. We also believe
that painting with thick asphalt or dam pp roof mastic might work;
but the problem isn't really solved. Of course, masonry versions
in which columns are made of terracotta pipe or concrete pipe
and filled with dense concrete, ought to work alright. But even
in these cases, we are doubtful about the exact structural validity

CONSTRUCTION
of the pattern. We believe that some kind of structure wl1ich is
continuous with the gronnd is needed: but we quite haven't
been able to work it out. lVIeanwhile, we state this pattern as a
kind of challenge.
Namely:
Try to find a way of making foundations in which the
columns themselves go right into the earth, and spread
out there-so that the footing is continuous with the material
of the column, and the column, with its footing, like
a tree root, can resist tension and horizontal shear as well as
compression.

To make foundations like this for hollow concrete, filled box
columns, start with a pit for each foundation, place the hollow
column in the pit, and pour the column and the foundation
integrally, in one continuous pour-Box COLUMNS   I ). Later,
when you build the ground floor slab, tie the concrete into the
foundations-GROUND FLOOR SLAB   I ).

A raised ground floor slab built inside a brick perimeter wall.

CONSTRUCTION
When the ground is relatively level, a concrete slab which sits
directly on the ground is the most natural and cheapest way of
building a ground floor. Wood floors are expensive, need air
space underneath them, and need to be built up on continuous
foundation walls or beams. Prefabricated floor panels also need a
structure of some sort to support them. A slab floor, on the other
hand, uses the earth for support, and can supply the foundations
which are needed to support walls, by simple thickening.
The one trouble with slabs is that they can easily feel cold
and damp. We believe that this feeling is at least as much a
psychological one as a physical one given a well-made and insulated
slab), and that the feeling is most pronounced with slabs
that are on grade. We therefore propose that the slab be raised
from the ground. This can be done by not excavating the ground
at all, instead only leveling it, and placing the usual bed of
rubble and gravel on top of the ground. In normal practice,
the ground is excavated so that the top of the rubble is slightly
below grade, and the top of the slab only jwt above the ground.)
Therefore:
Build a ground floor slab, raised slightly-six or nine
inches above the ground-by first building a low perimeter
wall around the building, tied into the column foundations,
and then filling it with rubble, gravel, and concrete.

... if you use ROOT FOUNDATIONS 14), the columns must be
made at the same time as the foundations, since the foundation
and the column are integral. The height, spacing, and thickness
of the various columns in the building are given by FINAL
COLUMN DISTRIBUTION   I ). This pattern describes the details
of construction for the individual col nmns.

In all the world's traditional and historic buildings, the
columns are expressive, beautiful, and treasured elements.
Only in modern buildings have they become ugly and
meaningless.
The fact is that no one any longer knows how to make a column
which is at the same time beautiful and structurally efficient. We
discuss the problem under seven separate headings:
I. Columns feel uncomfortable unless they are reasonably
thick and solid. This feeling is rooted in structural reality. A
long thin column, carrying a heavy load, is likely to fail by
buckling: and our feelings, apparently, are particularly tuned in
to this possibility.
We do not wish to exaggerate the need for thickness. Taken
too far, it could easily become a mannerism of a rather ridiculous
sort. But columns do need to be comfortable and solid, and only
thin when they are short enough to be in no danger of buckling.
When the column is a free-standing one, then the need for
thickness becomes essential. This is fully discussed under COLUMN
PLACE 26).
 Structural arguments lead to exactly the same conclusion.
Thin, high strength materials, like steel tubes and prestressed
concrete, arc ruled out by GOOD MATERIALS  07). Lower strength
materials which are ecologically sound have to be relatively fat
to cope with the loads.
 The column must be cheap. An  by  solid wood column
is too expensive; thick brick or stone columns are almost out of
the question in today's market.
IO I
CONSTRUCTION
 It must be warm to the touch. Concrete columns and painted
steel columns have an unpleasant surface and are not very easy to
face.
 If the column takes bending, the highest strength materials
should be concentrated toward the outside. Buckling and bending
strength both depend on the moment of inertia, which is highest
when the material is as far as possible from the neutral axis. A
stalk of grass is the archetypal example.

 BOX COLUMNS
 The column must be easy to connect to foundations, beams,
and walls. Precast concrete columns are very hard to connect. So
are metal columns. Brick columns are easy to connect to brick
walls-not to the lighter weight skin structures required by WALL
MEMBRANE 18).
 The column must be hand nailable, and hand cuttable to
make on-site modification and later repair as easy as possible.
Again, current materials do not easily meet this requirement.
A column which has all these features is a box column, where
the hollow tube can be made as thick as is required, and then
filled with a strong compressive material. Such a column can be
made cheaper than comparable wood and steel columns; the
outer skin can be made with a material that is beautiful, easy to
repair, and soft to the touch; the column can be stiffened for
bending, either by the skin itself, or by extra reinforcing; and,
for structural integrity, the fill material can be made continuous
with the column's footings and beams.
An example of a box column which we have built and tested
is a wooden box column, made with I inch wooden planks and
filled with lightweight concrete the same density as wood, so that
it has the overall volume and mass of a heavy  inch solid
column. The drawing opposite shows these wooden box columns
being made.
Possible box columns
Box columns can be made in many other ways. One kind is
made by stacking  by  inch lightweight concrete blocks, and
filling the cavity with a concrete of the same density. Some wire
reinforcing inside the column is required to give the column
tensile strength. A hollow brick column, filled with earth is

another possibility. Concrete, vinyl, and terracotta sewer pipe
filled with lightweight concrete and reinforced with mesh; a
resin-impregnated cardboard tube filled with earth; or two concentric
cardboard tubes with the cuter ring filled with concrete
and the inner ring filled with earth; still another is made from
a tube of chicken wire wesh, filled with rubble, plastered and

self-aligning hollow tiles for the skin. The tiles can be molded
by hand with a hand press-in concrete or tile; the soft tile will
make beautiful rose red, soft warm columns.

Therefore:
Make the columns in the form of filled hollow tubes,

strong in compression. Give the skin of the column some
tensile strength-preferably in the skin itself, but perhaps
with reinforcing wires in the fill.

As you already know, it is best to build the columns integral
with ROOT FOUNDATIONS  14 on the ground floor, or integral
with the FLOOR-CEILING VAULTS 19 on upper floors, and
to fill them in one continuous pour. Once the columns are in
position, put in the PERIMETER BEAMS   I ), and fill the beams
at the same time that you fill the upper part of the column.
If the column is free standing, put in column braces or column
capitals-COLUMN CONNECTION 27)-to brace the connection
between the two. And make the columns especially thick, or build
them in pairs, where they are free-standing, so that they form a

... this pattern helps to complete BOX COLUMNS   I ), by
tying the tops of the columns together once they are in position.
It also helps to form the bearing surface for the edge of the
FLOOR-CEILING VAULTS 19). For this reason, the positions of
the perimeter beams must correspond exactly to the edges of the
vaults laid out in FLOOR AND CEILING LAYOUT   Io).

If you conceive and build a room by first placing columns
at the corners, and then gradually weaving the walls and
ceiling round them, the room needs a perimeter beam
around its upper edge.
It is the beam, connecting the columns which creates a volume
you can visualize, before it is complete; and when the columns
are standing in the ground, you need the actual physical perimeter
beam, to generate this volume before your eyes, to let you see the
room as you are building it, and to tie the tops of the columns
together, physically.
These reasons are conceptual. But of course, the conceptual
simplicity and rightness of the beam around the room comes, in
the end, from the more basic fact that this beam has a number of
related structural functions, which make it an essential part of
any room built as a natural structure. The perimeter beam has
four structural functions:
I. It forms the natural thickening between the wall membrane
and vault membrane, described in EFFICIENT STRUCTURE
( 06).
 It resists the horizontal thrust of the ceiling vault, wherever
there are no outside external buttresses to do it, and no other
vaults to lean against.
 It functions as a lintel, wherever doors and windows pierce
the wall membrane.
 It transfers loads from columns in upper storys to the
columns and the wall membrane below it, and spreads these loads
out to distribute them evenly between the columns and the
membrane.

CONSTRUCTION
These functions of the perimeter beam show that the beam
must be as continuous as possible with walls and columns above,
the walls and columns below, and with the floor. If we follow
GOOD MATERIALS 07), the beam must also be easy to make, and
easy to cut to different lengths.
Available beams do not meet these requirements. Steel beams
and precast or pres tressed beams cannot easily be tied in to the
wall and floor to become continuous with these membranes. Far
more important, they cannot easily be cut on site to conform to
the exact dimensions of the different rooms which will occur m an
organic plan .

 PERIMETER BEAMS
Of course, wood beams meet both requirements: they are
easy to cut and can be tied along their lengths to wall and floor
membranes. However, as we have said in Gooo MATERIALS
(207), wood is unavailable in many places, and even where it is
available, it is becoming scarce and terribly expensive, especially
in the luge sizes needed for beams.
To avoid the use of wood, we have designed a perimeter
beam-shown opposite-which is consistent with our box column,
and designed to be used together with it. It is a beam made by
first nailing up a channel made of wooden planks to the columns,
before the wall membranes are made; then putting in reinforcing,
and filling up with ultra-lightweight  pounds per cubic foot
concrete, after the walls are made and filled. This beam is excellent
for continuity. The wooden channel can first be made continuous
with other skin elements by nailing, and the fill can
then be made continuous by filling columns and beams and walls
and vault in one continuous ponr-see WALL MEMBRANES( I )
and FLOOR-CEILINGV AULTS(  I ).
Of course, there are many other ways of making a perimeter
beam. First of all, there are several variants of our design: the
U-shaped channel can be made of fiberboard, plywood, precast
lightweight concrete, and, in every case, filled with lightweight
concrete. Then there are various traditional perimeter beamsthe
Japanese version or the early American versions come to
mind. And then there are a variety of structures which are not
exactly even beams-but still act to spread vertical loads and
counteract horizontal thrusts. A row of brick arches might function
in this way, in a far fetched case so might a tension ring of
ju nglc creeper.
Therefore:
Build a continuous perimeter beam around the room,
strong enough to resist the horizontal thrust of the vault
above, to spread the loads from upper stories onto columns,
to tie the columns together, and to function as a lintel over
openings in the wall. Make this beam continuous with
columns, walls and floor above, and columns and walls
below.

Remember to place reinforcing in such a way that the perimeter
beam acts in a horizontal direction as well as vertical.
When it forms the base for a FLOOR-CEILING VAULT 19 it
must be able to act as a ring beam to resist all those residual horizontal
outward thrusts not contained by the vault. Strengthen

membrane, "stretched" between :idjaccnt columns and
continuollS with them, the columns themselves placed at frequent

describes the way to stretch the membrane from column to
column to form the walls.
In organic construction the walls must take their share
of the loads. They must work continuously with the structure
on all four of their sides; and act to resist shear and
bending, and take loads in compression.
When walls arc working like this, tney arc essentially structural
membranes: they are continuous in two dimensions; together with
stiffeners and columns they resist loads in compression; and they
create a continuous rigid connection between columns, beams, and
floors, botl above and below, to help resist shear and bending.
By contrast, curtain walls and walls whicl are essentially "infill,"
do not act as membranes. They may function as walls in
other respects-they insubte, enclose, they define space-but
they do not contribute to the overall structural solidity of the
building. They let the frame do ;ill the work; structurally they
are wasted. !For the details of the argument that every part of
the structure must cooperate to take loads, sec EfTICJENT sTRUCTU

GOOD MATERIALS  07 tells us that we should use hand
cuttable, nailable, ecologically sound materials, which one can
work with home tools, with the emphasis on earthen fill materials
and sheet materials.
GRADUAL STIFFENING 08 tells us that the process of building
should be such that one can start with a flimsy structure and
stiffen it during the course of construction, as materials are put
in place, so that the process can be smooth and continuous.

 WAT.L MEMBRANE
An example. of such a wall that we have built and tested uses
gypboard for the inner skin, ship-lapped wooden boards for the
outer skin and ultra-lightweight concrete for the fill. The wall is
built by fixing nailing blocks to the sides of columns. We nail the
skin to the nailing blocks, put chickenwire into the cavity to reinforce
the concrete against shrinkage, and then pour the lightweight
concrete into the cavity. The wall needs to be braced during pouring,
and you can't pour more than two or three feet at a time: the
pressure gets too great. The last pour fills the perimeter beam
and the top of the wall, and so makes them integral. The drawing
opposite shows one way that we h;ive made this particular kind
of wall membrane.
Th is wall is solid about the density of wood), has good acoustic
and thermal properties, can easily be built to conform to free and
irregular plans, and can be nailed into. And because of its stiffeners,
the walJ is very strong for its thickness.
Other versions of this pattern: I The skin can be formed
from hollow structural tiles or concrete blocks, with a concrete or
earthen fill.  The exterior skin might be brick, the interior
skin plywood or gypboard. In either case the columns would have
to be holJow tile, or concrete pipe, or other masonry box columns.
(3 The skin might be formed with wire mesh, gradually filled
with concrete and rubble, and stuccoed on the outside, with
plaster on the inside. The columns in this case can be built in the
same way-out of a wire mesh tube filled with rubble and concrete.
(4 It may also be possible to use gypboard for both skins,
inside and out. The gypboard on the outer side could then be
covered with building paper, lath, and stucco.
Therefore:
Build the wall as a membrane which connects the
columns and door frames and windows frames and is, at
least in part, continuous with them. To build the wall, first
put up an inner and an outer membrane, which can function
as a finished surface; then pour the fill into the wall.

CONSTRUCTION
inner and outer membrane
Remember that in a stiffened wall, the membranes can be
much thinner than you might expect, because the stiffeners prevent
buckling. In some cases they can be as thin as two inches in
a one story building, three inches at the bottom of a two-story
building and so on-see FINAL COLUMN DISTRIBUTION  13).
Membranes can be made from hollow tile, lightweight concrete
block, plywood, gypboard, wood planks, or any other sheet type
material which would make a nice surface, which is easy to nail
into, comfortable to touch, and so on. If the inner sheet is gypsum
board, it can be finished with a skim coat of plaster-SOFT INSIDE
WALLS ). The outer sheet can be made of I inch boards,
tongue and grooved; or exterior grade plywood; or exterior
board hung with tile, shingles, or plastered-LAPPED OUTSIDE

or tile: in this case, columns must be of the same material-soFT

 I  FLOOR-CEILING
VAULTS**

... we have already discussed the fact that ordinary joist floors
and slab floors are inefficient and wasteful because the tension
materials they use to resist bending are less common than pure
compression materials-EFFICIENT STRUCTURE  06) GOOD MATERIALS
(207), and that it is therefore desirable to use vaults
wherever possible. This pattern gives the shape and construction
of the vaults. The vaults will help to complete FLOOR AND CEILING
LAYOUT ), and PERIMETER BEAMS 17); and, most important
of all, they will help to create the CEl!.lNG HEIGHT
VARIETY  I 0 in different rooms.

We seek a ceiling vault shape which will support a live
load on the floor above, form the ceiling of the room below,
and generate as little bending and tension as possible
so that compressive materials can be relied on.
The vault shape is governed by two constraints: the ceiling cannot
be lower than about  feet at the edge of the room, except
in occasional attic rooms; and the ceiling in the middle of the
room should vary with the room size   to  feet for large
rooms,  to  feet for middle sized rooms, and  to  feet for the
very smallest alcoves and corners-see CEILING HEIGHT VARIETY
( I 0)).
We know, from structural considerations, that a circular shell
dome will generate virtually no bending moments when its rise
is at least  to  per cent of its diameter. This is established in
studies and tests of shell structures, and is corroborated by our
own computer studies. For a room  feet across, this requires a
rise of about  inches, making a total height of  to  feet in
the middle; for a room I  feet across, it requires a rise of -3
feet, making a height of  to  feet in the middle.
Luckily, these vault heights are just congruent with the
needed ceiling heigh ts. We may say, therefore, that the ideal
vault for an inhabited space is one which springs from  to  feet
at the edge, and rises I  to  per cent of the smaller diameter.
!028
2I FLOOR-CEILING VAULTS
There are various possible ways of making a circular or elliptical
vault spring from a square or rectangular room.
I. One type of vault is made by arching diagonal ribs from
corner to corner; and then spacing straight line elements across
the ribs.
 Another type is a pure dome supported on sguinches.
 Another is based on a rectangular grid of arched ribs. The
edge ribs are entirely flat, and the center ribs have the greatest
curvature. In the end, each part of the vault is curved in three
dimensions, and the corners are slightly flattened.
Each of these three vaults makes sense in slightly different
circumstances. The first is the easiest to conceive, but it has a
slight structural disadvantage: its surface panels are curved in one
direction only-because they are made of straight line elements
-and cannot therefore achieve the strength of a doubly curved
vault. The second is the hardest to conceive; however, it comes
naturally from the intersection of a spherical shape and a rectangular
one. If one were to make a vault by using a balloon as a form,
pushed up within the perimeter beams, the second type would
be the easiest to use. In the particular building technique we have
been using, the third type is easiest to use, because it is particularly

CONSTRUCTION
simple to lay out the arched ribs which pr01·ide the formwork. It
flattens out at the corners, which could create bending mon1ents
and require tension materials. However, in lightweight concrete
we have found that it docs not require any more than the
shrinkage reinforcement, which is needed anyway.
We shall now Jescribe a very simple way of making a vault.
Bear in mind that we considered it essential that the vault be
built up gradually, and that it could be fitted to any room shape,
without difficulty. This technique is not only che:1p and simple. It
is also one of the only w,,ys we ha,·e found of fitting a vault to
an arbitrary room shape. It works for rectangular rooms, rooms
that are just off-rectangles, and odd-shaped rooms. It c:in be
applied to rooms of any size. The height of the vault can be
varied according to its position in the 01·er:1ll arr,1r of ceiling

The rest of the vault should not be poured until all edges are

the weight of the vault down, it is important that even the ultralightweight
concrete be further lightened, by mixing it with 0

Or voids can be made very much like the vaults themselves by
making arches with latticing between columns and then stretching
burlap from these arches to the dome. The drawing opposite
shows the sequence of construction.

test compressive strength of  psi. Tensile strength is taken as
 psi, and bending as . inch pounds per inch. These figures
are based on the assumption that the concrete is unreinforced.
Dead loads were figured at  pounds per square foot assuming
 per cent voids in the spandrels of the vault. Live loads were
taken to be  pounds per square foot.
According to the analysis, under such loading the largest
compressive stress in this dome occurs near the base at mid points
of all four sides and is I  psi. Outward thrust is the greatest at
quarter points along all four walls, and is I  pounds. The
maximum tension of  psi occurs at the corners. Maximum
bending is IO inch pounds per inch. All of these are well within
the capacity of the vault, and besides, shrinkage reinforcement
in the vault will make it even stronger.
The analysis shows, then, that even though the vault is an
impure form it contains square panels which are actually sagging
within the overall configuration of the vault shape), its structural
behavior is still close enough to that of a pure vault to work
essentially as a compression structure. There are small amounts of
local bending; and the corner positions of the dome suffer small
amounts of tension, but the chickenwire needed for shrinkage will
take care of both these stresses.
Here are some other possible ways of building such a vault:
To begin with, instead of wood for the lattice work, many
other materials can be used: plastic strips, thin metal tubes,
bamboos. Other resins besides polyester resins can be used to
stiffen the burlap. If resins are unavailable, then the form for
the vault can be made by placing lattice strips as described, and
then stretching chickenwire over it, then burlap soaked in mortar
which is allowed to harden before concrete is placed. It might
also be possible to use matting stiffened with glue, perhaps even
papier mache.
It is possible that similar vaults could be formed by altogether
different means: perhaps with pneumatic membranes or balloons.
And it is of course possible to form vaults by using very traditional
methods: bricks or stones, on centering, like the beautiful vaults
used in renaissance churches, gothic cathedrals, and so on.

 I  FLOOR-CEILING VAULTS
Therefore:
Build floors and ceilings in the form of elliptical vaults
which rise between  and  per cent of the shorter span.
Use a type of construction which makes it possible to fit the
vault to any shaped room after the walls and columns are
in position: on no account use a prefabricated vault.

When the main vault is finished, mark the positions of all
those columns which will be placed on the floor above it-FINAL
COLUMN DISTRIBUTION   I ). Whenever there are columns
which are more than  feet away from the perimeter beam,
strengthen the vault with ribs and extra reinforcing to withstand
the vertical forces.
Put all the upper columns in position before you pour the floor
of the vault, so that when you pour it, the concrete will pour
around the column feet, and anchor them firmly in the same way
that they are anchored in the foundations-ROOT FOUNDATIONS

 ROOF VAULTS*

... if the roof is a flat ROOF GARDEN II ), it can be built
just like any FLOOR-CEILING VAULT 19). But when it is a
sloping roof, according to the character of SHELTERING ROOF
(II ), it needs a new construction, specifically adapted to the
shape which can enclose a volume.

What is the best shape for a roof?
For some reason, this is the most loaded, the most emotional
question, that can be asked about building construction. ln all our
investigations of patterns, we have not found any other pattern
which generates so much discussion, so much disagreement, and
so much emotion. Early childhood images play a vital role; so
does cultural prejudice. It is hard to imagine an Arab building
with a pitched roof; hard to imagine a New England farmhouse
with a Russian onion roof over a tower; hard to imagine a
person who has grown up among pitched steep wooden roofs,
happy under the stone cones of the trulli.
Alt over the world.

CONSTRUCTION
For this reason, in this pattern we make our discussion as
fundamental as we can. We shall do everything we can to obtain
the necessary features which we can treat as invariant for all roofs,
regardless of people or culture-yet deep enough to allow a rich
assortment of cultural variations.
We approach the problem with the assumption that there are
no constraints created by techniques or availability of materials.
We are merely concerned with the optimum shape and distribution
of materials. Given a roughly rectangular plan, or plan
composed of rectangular pieces connected, what is the best shape
for the shell of the roof which covers them I
The requirements influencing the shape are these:
I. The feeling of shelter-SHELTERING ROOF 17). This requires
that the roof cover a whole wing that is, not merely room
by room). It requires that some of the roof be highly visiblehence,
that it have a fairly steep slope-and that some of the
roof be /lat and usable for gardens or terraces.
 The roof must definitely contain lived-in space-that is,
not just sit on top of the rooms which are all below-see SHELTERING
ROOF 17). This means it needs rather a steep slope at the
edge-because otherwise there is no headroom. This requires an
elliptical section dome, or a barrel vault which starts going up
vertically at the edge), or a very steep slope.
 In plan, each individual roof is a very rough rectangle, with
occasional variations. This follows from the way the roofs of a
building must, together, follow the social layout of the planROOF
LAYOUT  09).
 The roof shape must be relaxed-that is, it can be used in
any plan layout-and can be generated very simply from a few
generating lines which follow automatically from the plan-that
is, it must not be a tricky or contrived shape which needs a lot
of fiddling around to define it-STRUCTURE FOLLOWS SOCIAL
SPACES 05).
 Structural considerations require a curved shell, dome or
vault to eliminate as much bending as possible-see EFFICIENT
STRUCTURE  06 and GOOD MATERIALS  07). Of course, to
the extent that wood or steel or other tension materials are available,
this requirement can be relaxed.
 The roof is steep enough to shed rain and snow in climates

relaxed.
where they occur. Obviously, this aspect of the roof will vary
from climate to climate.
These requirements eliminate the following kinds of roofs:
I. Flat roofs. Flat roofs, except ROOF GARDENS  II  )·, are
already eliminated by the psychological arguments of SHELTERING
ROOFS II  and, of course, by structural considerations. A flat
roof is necessary where people are going to walk on it; but it is a
very inefficient structural shape since it creates bending.
 Pitched Roofs. Pitched roofs still require materials that can
withstand bending moment. The most common material for
pitched roofs-wood-is becoming scarce and expensive. As we
have said in GOOD MATERIALS  07), we believe it is most sensible
to keep wood for surfaces and not to use it as a structural material,
except in wood rich areas. Pitched roofs also need to be very
steep, indeed, to enclose habitable space as required by SHELTERING
ROOF II )-and hence rather inefficient.
 Dutch barn anrl mansard roofs. These roofs enclose habitable
space more efficiently than pitched roofs; but they have the
same structural drawbacks.
 Geodesic domes. These domes cover essentially circular
areas, and are not therefore useful in their ordinary formCASCADE

(  ). In the modified form, which comes when you stretch

CONSTRUCTION
the base into a rough rectangle, they become more or less congruent
with the class of vaults defined by this pattern.
 Cable nets and tents. These roofs use tensile materials instead
of compressive ones-they do not conform to the requirements
of GOOD MATERIALS  07). They are also very inefficient
when it comes to enclosing habitable space-and thus fail to meet
the requirements of STRUCTURE FOLLOWS SOCIAL SPACES  05).
The roofs which satisfy the requirements are all types of rectangular
barrel vaults or shells, with or without a peak, gabled or
hipped, and with a variety of possible cross sections. Almost any
one of these shells will be further strengthened by additional undulations
in the direction of the vault. Examples of possible cross
sections are given below. Remember that this does not include
those flat ROOF GARDENS    built over FLOOR-CEILING VAULTS
(219).)
Possible roof vaults.
'vVe have developed a range of roof vaults which are rather
similar to a pitched roof-but with a convex curve great enough
to eliminate bending, in some cases actually approaching barrel
vaults. One is shown in the drawing opposite; another is shown
below.
Another version of a '0of vault, built by Bob Harris in Oregon.

 ROOF VAULTS
We build the roof vault very much like the floor vaults:
I. First span the wing to be roofed with pairs of lattice strips
which are securely nailed at their ends to the perimeter beam,
and weighted at their apex so that the two pieces become slightly
curved.
 Make the frame for the ceiling under the roof frame at the
same time according to FLOOR-CEILING VAULTS 19).

for the ceiling may change according to the rooms under it.
 Now lay burlap over the ceiling frame, then resin, then I¼
inches of ultra-lightweight concrete-as for FLOOR-CEILING VAULTS
(219).
 Now lay burlap over the roof frame, tacking it onto the
lattice strips so that there is a -inch scallop in between the ribsto
form structural undulations in the skin. Again, paint the
burlap with resin; lay chicken wire and put a layer of lightweight
concrete over the en tire roof.
We have analyzed a -foot roof of this type by means of a
computerized finite element analysis similar to the one described
for FLOOR-CEILING VAULTS   I ). The analysis shows that the
maximum membrane compressive stress in the roof is . psi; the
maimum membrane tensile stress is . psi, and the maximum diagonal
membrane stress which develops from the maximum shear
of 1. psi is I . psi. These stresses are within the capacity of the
material See allowable stresses given in FLOOR-CEILING VAULT
(219 ). The maximum membrane bending moment is  inch
pounds per inch which is higher than the capacity of the unreinforced
section, but extrapolations from our data show that this
will be comfortably taken care of by the reinforcing which is
needed anyway for shrinkage. Roofs with smaller spans, for a
typical WING OF LIGHT  I 06), will be even stronger.
Of course there are dozens of other ways to make a roof vault.
Other versions include ordinary barrel vaults, lamella structures
in the form of barrel vaults, elongated geodesic domes built up
from s ruts), vaults built up from plastic sheets, or fiberglass, or
corrugated metal.
But, in one way or another, build your roofs according to the
invariant defined below, remembering that it lies somewhere in
between the Crystal Palace, the stone vaults of Alberobello, mud
huts of the Congo, grass structures of the South Pacific, and the
corrugated iron huts of our own time. This shape is required
whenever you are working with materials which are in pure
compression.
Obviously, if you have access to wood or steel and want to use
it, you can modify this shape by adding tension members. However,
we believe that these tension materials will become more

and more r'1fe as time goes on and that the pure compression
shape will gradually become a universal.
Therefore:
Build the roof vault either as a cylindrical barrel vault, or
like a pitched roof with a slight convex curve in each of
the two sloping sides. Put in undulations along the vault,
to make the shell more effective. The curvature of the main
shell, and of the undulations, can vary with the span;
the bigger the span, the deeper the curvature and undulations
need to be.

... imagine that you are now standing in the built-up frame of
a partly constructed building, with the columns and beams in
place-BOX COLUMNS 16), PERIMETER BEAMS 17). You
know roughly where you want doors and windows from ZEN
VIEW ), STREET WINDOWS 4), WINDOW PLACE 0),
WINDOWSO VERLOOKINGL IFE 2), CORNER DOORS( 6). Now
you can settle on the exact positions of the frames.
Finding the right position for a window or a door is a
subtle matter. But there are very few ways of building
which take this into consideration.
In our current ways of building, the delicacy of placing a
window or a door has nearly vanished. But it is just this refinement,
down to the last foot, even to the last inch or two, which
makes an immense difference. Windows and doors which are
just right are always like this. Find a beautiful window. Study it.
See how different it would be if its dimensions varied a few
inches in either direction.
Now look at the windows and doors in most buildings made
during the last  years. Assume that these openings are in
roughly the right place, but notice how they could be improved
if they were free to shift around, a few inches here and there,
each one taking advantage of its own special circumstances-the
space immediately inside and the view outside.
It is almost always a rigid construction system, combined with
a formal aesthetic, which holds these windows in such a death
grip. There is nothing else to this regularity, for it is possible
to relax the regularity without losing structural integrity.
It is also important to realize that this final placing of windows
and doors can only be done on site, with the rough frame of the
building in position. It is impossible to do it on paper. But on
the site it is quite straightforward and natural: mock up the
openings with scraps of lumber or string and move them around
until they feel right; pay careful attention to the organization of
the view and the kind of space that is created inside.

CONSTRUCTION
Getting it just right.
As we shall see in a later pattern-SMALL PANES ), it is
not necessary to make the windows any special dimensions, or to
try and make them multiples of any standard pane size. Whatever
dimensions this pattern gives each window, it will then be possible
to divide it up, to form small panes, which will be different in
their exact shape and size, according to the window they are in.
However, although there is no constraint on the exact dimension
of the windows, there is a general rule of thumb, which will
make window sizes vary: Windows, as a rule, should become
smaller as you get higher up in the building.
I. The area of windows needed for light and ventilation depends
on the size of rooms, and rooms are generally smaller on
upper stories of the building-the communal rooms are generally
on the ground floor and more private rooms upstairs.
 The amount of daylight coming through a window depends
on the area of open sky visible through the window. The higher
the window, the more open sky is visible because nearby trees
and buildings obscure less)-so less window area is needed to get
sufficient daylight in.
 To feel safe on the upper stories of a building, one wants
more enclosure, smaller windows, higher sills-and the higher off
the ground one is, the more one needs these psychological protections.
Therefore:
On no account use standard doors or windows. Make
each window a different size, according to its place.

to its position in the building. This means that it is obviously
impossible to use standard windows and even impossible to irake
each window a simple multiple of standard panes. But it will
still be possible to glaze each window, since the procedure for

 LOW SILL

... this pattern helps to complete NATURAL DOORS AND WINDOWS
( 21), and the special love for the view, and for the earth outside,
which ZEN vrnw   ), WINDOW PLACE  I So and WINDOWS
OVERLOOKING LIFE  I 2 all need.

One of a window's most important functions is to put
you in touch with the outdoors. If the sill is too high, it
cuts you off.
The "right" height for a ground floor window sill is astonishingly
low. Our experiments show that sills which are  or
inches from the floor are perfect. This is much lower than the
window sills which people most often build: a standard window
sill is about  to  inches from the ground. And it is higher
than French doors and windows which usually have a bottom rail
of  to IO inches. The best height, then, happens to be a rather
uncommon one.
We first give the detailed explanation for this phenomenon,
and we then explain the modifications which are necessary on
upper floors.
People are drawn to windows because of the light and the
view outside-they are natural places to sit by when reading,
talking, sewing, and so on, yet most windows have sill heights of
 inches or so, so that when you sit down by them you cannot
see the ground right near the window. This is unusually frustrating-
you almost have to stand up to get a complete view.
In "The Function of Windows: A Reappraisal" Building
Science, Vol. , Pergamon Press, I 67, pp. 7-  I), Thomas
Markus shows that the primary function of windows is not to
provide light but to provide a link to the outside and, furthermore,
that this link is most meaningful when it contains a view of
the ground and the horizon. Windows with high sills cut out the
view of the ground.
On the other hand, glass all the way down to the floor is
undesirable. It is disturbing because it seems contradictory and

even dangerous. It feels more like a door tnan a window; yon
nave the feeling that yon ongnt to be able to walk through it. If
the sill is  to  inches high, you can comfortably see the
ground, even if yon are a foot or two away from tne window,
and it still feels like a window rather than a door.
On upper stories the sill height needs to be sligntly higher.
The sill still needs to be low to see the ground, but it is unsafe
if it is too low. A sill height of about  inches allows you to see
most of the ground, from a chair nearby, and still feel safe.
Therefore:
When determining exact location of windows also decide
which windows should have low sills. On the first floor,
make the sills of windows which you plan to sit by between
 and  inches high. On the upper stories, make them

... this pattern helps to complete the work of LIGHT ON TWO
SIDES OF EVERY ROOM ), by going even further to reduce
glare; and it helps to shape the FRAMES AS THICKENED EDGES
(225).
Windows with a sharp edge where the frame meets the
wall create harsh, blinding glare, and make the rooms they
serve uncomfortable.
They have the same effect as the bright headlights of an oncoming
car: the glare prevents you from seeing anything else on
the road because your eye cannot simultaneously adapt to the
bright headlights and to the darkness of the roadway. Just so, a
window is always much brighter than an interior wall; and the
walls tend to be darkest next to the window's edge. The difference
in brightness between the bright window and the dark
wall around it also causes glare.
Glare ... and no glare.
To solve this problem, the edge of the window must be
splayed, by making a reveal between the window and the wall.
The splayed reveal then creates a transition area-a zone of
intermediate brightness-between the brightness of the window
and the darkness of the wall. If the reveal is deep enough and
the angle just right, the glare will vanish altogether.
But the reveal must be quite deep, and the angle of the splay
quite marked. In empirical studies of glare, Hopkinson and
 DEEP REVEALS
Petherbridge have found: I that the larger the reveal is, the
less glare there is;  the reveal functions best, when its brightness
is just halfway between the brightness of the window and
the brightness of the wall. "Discomfort Glare and the Lighting
of Buildings," Transactions of the Illuminating Engineering
Society, Vol. XV, No. , 50, pp. -59.)
Our own experiments show that this happens most nearly, when
the reveal lies at between  and  degrees to the plane of the
window; though, of course, the angle will vary with local conditions.
And, to satisfy the need for a "large" reveal, we have found
that the reveal itself must be a good Io to I  inches wide.
Therefore:
Make the window frame a deep, splayed edge: about a
foot wide and splayed at about  to  degrees to the plane
of the window, so that the gentle gradient of daylight gives
a smooth transition between the light of the window and
the dark of the inner wall.

 LOW DOORWAY
... some of the doors in a building play a special role in
creating transitions and maintaining privacy: it may be any of
the doors governed by FAMILY OF ENTRANCES  02), or MAIN
ENTRANCE    o), or THE FLOW THROUGH ROOMS  1 or
CORNER DOORS 6), or NATURAL DOORS AND WINDOWS 21).
This pattern helps to complete these doors by giving them a
special height and shape.
High doorways are simple and convenient. But a lower
door is often more profound.
The ' " rectangular door is snch a standard pattern, and is
so taken for granted, that it is hard to imagine how strongly it
dominates the experience of transition. There have been times,
however, when people were more sensitive to the moment of
passage, and made the shape of their doors convey the feeling of
transition.
An extreme case is the Japanese tea house, where a person
entering must literally kneel down and crawl in through a low
hole in the wall. Once inside, shoes off, the guest is entirely a
guest, in the world of his host.
Among architects, Frank Lloyd Wright used the pattern many
times. There is a beautifully low trellised walk behind Taliesin
West, marking the transition out of the main house, along the
path to the studios.
If you are going to try this pattern, test it first by pinning
cardboard up to effectively lower the frame. Make the doorway
low enough so that it appears "lower than usual"-then people
will immediately adapt to it, and tall people will not hit their
heads.
Therefore:
Instead of taking it for granted that your doors are
simply ' " rectangular openings to pass through, make
at least some of your doorways low enough so that the act
of going through the door is a deliberate thoughtful passage

. . . assume that columns and beams are in and that you have
marked the exact positions of the doors and windows with string
or pencil marks-NATURAL DOORS AND WINDOWS   I). You are
ready to build the frames. Remember that a well made frame
needs to be continuous with the surrounding wall, so that it
helps the building structurally-EFFICIENT STRUCTURE  06),
GRADUAL STIFFENING  08),

Any homogeneous membrane which has holes in it will
tend to rupture at the holes, unless the edges of the holes
are reinforced by thickening.
The most familiar example of this principle at work is in the
human face itself. Both eyes and mouth are surrounded by extra
bone and flesh. It is this thickening, around the eyes and mouth,
which gives them their character and helps to make them
such important parts of human physiognomy.
A building also has its eyes and mouth: the windows and the
doors. And following the principle which we observe in nature,
almost every building has its windows and doors elaborated, made
more special, by just the kind of thickening we see in eyes and
mouths.
The fact that openings in naturally occurring membranes are
invariably thickened can be easily explained by considering how
the lines of force in the membrane must flow around the hole.
The demity of the lines represent increasing
stress concentrations.

 FRAMES AS THICKENED EDGES
The increasing density of lines of force around the perimeter of
the hole requires that additional material be generated there to
prevent tearing.
Consider a soap film. When you prick the film, the tension
pulls the film apart, and it disintegrates. But if you insert a ring
of string into the film, the hole will hold, because the tensile
forces which accumulate around the opening can be held by the
thicker ring. This is in tension. The same is true for buckling
and compression. When a thin plate is functioning in compression
and a hole is made in it, the hole needs stiffening. It is important
to recognize that this stiffening is not only supporting the
opening itself against collapse, but it is taking care of the stresses
in the membrane which would normally be distributed in that
part of the membrane which is removed. Familiar examples of
such stiffening in plates are the lips of steel around the portholes
in a ship or in a locomotive cab.
A door frnme as a thickening.
The same is true for doors and windows in a building. Where
the walls are made of wood planks and I igh tweigh t concrete
fill-see WALL MEMBRANES   I )-the thickened frames can
be made from the same wood planks, placed to form a bulge, and
then filled to be continuous with the wall. If other types of skin
are used in the wall membranes, there will be other kinds of
thickening: edges formed with chicken wire, burlap, and resin,
filled with concrete; edges formed with chicken wire Ji.lied with
rubble, and then mortar, plaster; edges formed with brick, filled,
then plastered.

CONSTRUCTION
More general examples of frames as thickened edges exist all
over the world. They include the thickening of the mud around
the windows of a mud hut, the use of stone edges to the opening
in a brick wall because the stone is stronger, the use of double
studs around an opening in stud construction, the extra stone
around the windows in a gothic church, the extra weaving round
the hole in any basket hut.
Therefore:
Do not consider door and window frames as separate
rigid structures which are inserted into holes in walls.
Think of them instead as thickenings of the very fabric of
the wall itself, made to protect the wall against the concentrations
of stress which develop around openings.
In line with this conception, build the frames as thickenings
of the wall material, continuous with the wall itself,
made of the same materials, and poured, or built up, in a
manner which is continuous with the structure of the
wall.

certain columns, especially those which are free standing,
play an important social role, beyond their structural role as
COLUMNS AT THE CORNERS   l2). These are, especially, the
columns which help to form arcades, galleries, porches, walkways,
and outdoor rooms-PUBLIC OUTDOOR ROOM  ), ARCADES
( l l ), OUTDOOR ROOM  I  ), GALLERY SURROUND  I 6), SIXFOOT
BALCONY ), TRELLISED WALK 4). This pattern defines
the character these columns need to make them function
socially.
Thin columns, spindly columns, columns which take
their shape from structural arguments alone, will never
make a comfortable environment.
The fact is, that a free-standing column plays a role in shaping
human space. It marks a point. Two or more together define a
wall or an enclosure. The main function of the columns, from a
human point of view, is to create a space for human activity.
In ancient times, the structural arguments for columns coincided
in their implications with the social arguments. Columns
made of brick, or stone, or timber were always large and thick,
It was easy to make useful space around them.

pear altogether. Four inch steel pipes or  inch reinforced concrete
columns break up space, but they destroy it as a place for
human action, because they do not create "spots" where people
can be comfortable.
T !tin columns of the plastic world.
In these times, it is therefore necessary to reintroduce, consciously,
the social purposes which columns have, alongside their
structural functions. Let us try to define these social purposes
exactly.
A column affects a volume of space around it, according to the
situation. The space has an area that is roughly circular, perhaps
 feet in radius.
.... - - ..
The space around the column.
When the column is too thin, or lacks a top or bottom, this entire
volume-an area of perhaps  square feet-is lost. It cannot be a
satisfactory place in its own right: the column is too thin to lean
against, there is no way to build a seat up against it, there is no
natural way to place a table or a chair against the column. On
the other hand, the column still breaks up the space. It subtly
prevents people from walking directly through that area: we notice
J066
 COLUMN PLACE
that people tend to give these thin columns a wide berth; and it
prevents people from forming groups.
In short, if the column has to be there, it will destroy a
considerable area unless it is made to be a place where people
feel comfortable to stay, a natural focus, a place to sit down, a
place to lean.
Therefore:
When a column is free standing, make it as thick as a
man-at least  inches, preferably  inches: and form
places around it where people can sit and lean comfortably:
a step, a small seat built up against the column, or a space
formed by a pair of columns.

thick columns

You can get the extra thickness quite cheaply if you build the
column as a BOX COLUMN   I  ; complete the "place" the column
forms, by giving it a "roof" in the form of a column capital,
or vault which springs from the column, or by bracing the column
against the beams-coLUMN CONNECTION    ). And when it
makes sense, make the column base a SJTTJNG WALL  3), a place
for flowers-RAISED FLOWERS  ), or a p!.ce for a chair or
table--DJFFERENT CHAJRS    I . ...
 COLUMN CONNECTIONS**

... the columns are in position, and have been tied together by
a perimeter beam-nox COLUMNS 16), PERIMETER BEAMS
( I ). According to the principles of continuity which govern the
basic structure-EFFICIENT STRUCTURE  06), the connections
need stiffening to lead the forces smoothly from the beams into
the columns, especially when the columns are free standing as
they are in an arcade or balcony-ARCADE  19), GALLERY SURROUND(
166), SIX-FOOTB ALCONY( ), COLUMNP LACE 26).
You may also do the same in the upper corners of your door and
window frames-FRAMES AS THICKENED EDGES     )-making
arched openings.
The strength of a structure depends on the strength of
its connections; and these connections are most critical of
all at corners, especially at the corners where the columns
meet the beams.
There are two entirely different ways of looking at a connection:
I. As a source of rigidity, which can be strengthened by triangulation,
to prevent racking of the frame. This is a moment
connection: a brace. See the upper picture.
 As a source of continuity, which helps the forces to flow
easily around the corner in the process of transferring loads by
changing the direction of the force. This is a continuity connection:
a capital. See the lower picture.
 A column connection aJ a brace.
As a building is erected, and throughout its life, it settles,
creating tiny stresses within the structure. When the settling is
uneven, as it most always is, the stresses are out of balance; there
is strain in every part of the building, whether or not that part of
the building was designed to accept strain and transmit the forces
on down to tf1e ground. The parts of the building tl1at are not
designed to carry these forces become the weak points of the
building subject to fracture and rupture.

flu.,.,_,.
Effects of uneven stresses on a frame.
Rectangular frames, especially, have these cracks at the corners
because the transmission of the load is discontinuous there. To
solve this problem the frame must be braced-made into a
rigid frame that transmits the forces around it as a whole without
distorting. The bracing is required at any right-angled corner
between columns and beams or in the corners of door and window
frames.
 A column connection as a capital.
This happens most effectively in an arch. The arch creates a
continuous body of compressive material, which transfers vertical
forces from one vertical axis to another. It works effectively because
the line of action of a vertical force in a continuous compressive
medium spreads out downward at about  degrees.
And a column capital is, in this sense, acting as a small, underdeveloped
arch. It reduces the length of the beam-and so reduces
bending stress. And it begins to provide the path for the
forces as they move from one vertical axis to another, through the
medium of the beam. The larger the capital, the better.
'I ' . iliJ
A capital tl,at acts the same way as an atch.
A column connection will work best when it acts both as a
column capital and as a column brace. This means that it needs to

 COLUMN CONNECTIONS
be thick and solid, like a capital, so that there is a lot of material
for the forces to travel through, and stiff and strong and completely
continuous with the column and perimeter beam, like
the brace, so that it can work against shear and bending.
The bone structure, shown below uses both principles, to
transfer compressive stress from one strut to another, continuously,
throughout a three-dimensional space frame of struts. The structure
is most massive at the connections, where the forces change
direction.
Connections inside a bone.
A similar column connection can be made integral with
poured hollow columns and beams. The forms for the connection
are gussets made of skin material: then fill the column and the
gussets and the beam in a continuoL1s concrete pour.
Of all the patterns in the book, th is is one of the most widespread
and has taken the greatest variety of outward forms
throughout the course of history. A solid wood capita! on a wood
column, or a continuously poured column top, and arches of
stone, brick, or poured concrete are all examples. And, of course,
typical column capitals-a larger stone on a stone column or
typical gusset plate or brace-even if weak in some ways, also help
a great deal. But only relatively few of the his tori cal column connections
succeed fully in acting both as braces and as capitals.
Therefore:
Build connections where the columns meet the beams.

 STAIR VAULT*

... this pattern helps complete the rough shape and location
of stairs given by STAIRCASEA S A STAGE  3 and by STAIRCASE
VOLUME 5). If you want to build a conventional stair, you can
find what you need in any handbook. But how to build a stair in a
way which is consistent with the compressive structure of EFFICIENT
STRUCTURE 06), without using wood or steel or
concrete-GOOD MATERIALS 07)?
Within a building technology which uses compressive
materials as much as possible, and excludes the use of
wood, it is natural to build stairs over a vaulted void, simply
to save weight and materials.
A concrete stair is usually made from precast pieces supported
by steel stringers; or it is formed in place, and then stripped
of its forms. But for the reasons already given in GOOD MATERIALS
( 07), precast concrete and steel are undesirable materials
to use-they call for modular planning; they are unpleasant
materials to touch, look at, and walk on; they are hard to work
with and modify in any relaxed way, since they call for special
tools.
Given the principles of EFFICIENT STRUCTURE  06), GOOD
MATERIALS 07)' and GRADUAL STIFFENING  08)' we suggest
that stairs be made like FLOOR-CEILING VAULTS 19)-by making
a half-vault to the slope of the stair), with lattice strips,
burlap, resin, chickenwire, and lightweight concrete. The steps
themselves can then be formed by using wood planks, or tiles,
as risers, and filling in the steps with trowelled concrete.
When we first wrote this pattern, we thought it was very doubtful-
and put it in mainly to be consistent with floor and roof
vaults'. Since then we have built a vaulted stair. It is a great success
-beautiful-and we recommend it heartily.
Therefore:
Build a curved diagonal vault in the same way that you

A lightweight concrete tread, colored, waxed, and polished can
be quite beautiful and soft enough to be comfortable-see FLOOR

called for in SOFT TILE AND BRICK  ).
The vaulted space under the stair can be used as an ALCOVE
(179 a CHILD CAVE 03), or CLOSETS BETWEEN ROOMS 8).
If it is plastered, like a regular ceiling-see FLOOR-CEILING
VAULTS 19), it makes a much more pleasant and useful space
than the space under an ordinary stair.

 DUCT SPACE
1n a building built according to the principles of EFFICIENT
STRUCTURE  06 and built with vaulted floors-FLOOR-c£1L1NG
VACLTS  19), there is a triangular volume, unused, around the
edge of every room. This is the most natural place to put the
ducts.
You never know where pipes and conduits are; they
are buried somewhere in the walls; but where exactly are
they?
In most buildings electric conduits, plumbing, drains, gas
pipes, telephone wires, and so on, are buried in the walls, in a
completely uncoordinated and disorganized way. This makes the
initial construction of the building complioted since it is difficult
to coordinate the installation of the various services with the
building of various parts of the building. It makes it difficult to
think about making any changes or additions to the building once
it is built since you don't know where the service lines are. And
it leaves a gap in our understanding of our surroundings: the organization
of utilities and services in the buildings we live in arc
a mystery to us.
We propose that all the services be located together and run
around the ceiling of each room in the spandrel between the
vaulted ceiling and the floor above-FLOOR-CEILING VAULTS
(219).
Heating and electrical conduits will be universal throughout
the building and should thus be run around every room. Plumbing
and gas lines will be around some rooms only. All lines will also
be concentrated vertically at the corners of rooms. Thus the lines
form vertical trunks from which horizontal loops spring. This
configuration of pipes and conduits is easy to understand and plug
into.

Therefore:
Make ducts to carry hot air conduit, plumbing, gas, and
other services in the triangular space, within the vault,
around the upper edge of every room. Connect the ducts
for different rooms by vertical ducts, in special chases, in
the corners of rooms. Build outlets and panels at intervals
along the duct for access to the conduits.

RADIANT HEAT*
... to complete WALL MEMBRANES 18), FLOOR-CEILING
VAULTS 19 and DUCT SPACE 29), use a biologically sensible
heating system.

This pattern is a biologically precise formulation of the
intuition that sunlight and a hot blazing fire are the best
kinds of heat.
Heat can be transmitted by radiation heat waves across empty
space), convection flow in air or liguids by mixing of molecules
and hot air rising), and conduction flow through a solid).
In most places, we get heat in all three ways from om environment:
conducted heat from the solids we touch, convected heat
in the air around us, and radiated heat from those sources of
radiation in our line of sight.
Of the three, conducted heat is trivial, since any surface hot
enough to conduct heat to us directly is too hot for comfort.
As far as the other two are concerned-convected heat and radiant
heat-we may ask whether there is any biological difference
in their effects on human beings. In fact there is.
It turns out that people are most comfortable when they
receive radiant heat at a slightly higher temperature than the
temperature of the air around them. The two most primitive
examples of this situation are:   Outdoors, on a spring day
when the air is not too hot but the sun is shining.   Around
an open fire, on a cool evening.
Most people will recognize intuitively that these are two
unusually comfortable situations. And in view of the fact that we
evolved as organisms in the open air, with plenty of sun, it is
not surprising that this condition happens to be so comfortable
for us. It is built into our systems, biologically.
Unfortunately, it happens that many of the most widely used
heating systems ignore this basic fact.
 RADIANT HEAT
Hot air systems, and buried pipes, and the so-called hot
water "radiators" do transmit some of their heat to us by means
of radiation, but most of the heat we get from them comes
from convection. The air gets heated and warms us as it swirls
around us. But, as it does so it creates that very uncomfortable
stuffy, over-heated, dry sensation. When convection heaters are
warm enough to heat us we feel stifled. If we turn the heat
down, it gets too cold.
The conditions in which people feel most comfortable require
a subtle balance of convected heat and radiant heat. Experiments
have established that the most comfortable balance between the
two, occurs when the average radiant temperature is about two
degrees higher than the ambient temperature. To get the average
radiant temperature in a room, we measure the temperature of
all the visible surfaces in a room, multiply the area of each surface
by its temperature, add these up, and divide by the total area.
For comfort, this average radiant temperature needs to be about
two degrees higher than the air temperature.
Since some of the surfaces in a room  windows and outside
walls), will usually be cooler than the indoor air temperature,
this means that at least some surfaces must be considerably warmer
to get the average up.
An open fire, which has a small area of very high temperature,
creates this condition in a cool room. The beautiful Austrian
and Swedish tiled stoves also do it very well. They are
massive stoves, made of clay bricks or tiles, with a tiny furnace

CONSTRUCTION
in the middle. A handful of twigs in the furnace give all their
heat to the clay of the stove itself, and this clay, like the earth,
keeps this heat and radiates it slowly over a period of many hours.
Radiant panels, with individual room control, and infrared
heaters hung from walls and ceilings, are possible high technology
sources of radiant heat. It is possible that sources of low-grade
radiant heat-like a hot water tank-might also work to very
much the same effect. Instead of insulating the tank, it might be
an excellent source of radiant heat, right in the center of the
house.
Therefore:
Choose a way of heating your space-especially those
rooms where people are going to gather when it is coldthat
is essentially a radiative process, where the heat comes
more from radiation than convection.

If you have followed earlier patterns, you may have rooms
which have a vaulted ceiling, with a steeply sloping surface close
to the wall, and with the major ducts behind that surfaceFLOOR-
CEILING VAULTS 19), DUCT SPACE 29). In this case,
it is natural to put the radiant heating panels on that sloping
surface.
But it is also very wonderful to make at least some part of the
radiant surfaces low enough so that seats can be built round them
and against them; on a cold day there is nothing better than a
seat against a warm stove-BUILT-IN SEATS  02).

 I DORMER WINDOWS*

... this pattern helps to complete SHELTERING RooF 17).
If you have followed sheltering roof, your roof has living space
within it: and it must therefore have windows in it, to bring
light into the roof. This pattern °is a special kind of WINDOW
PLACE 0), which completes the ROOF VAULTS 20), in these
situations.

We know from our discussion of SHELTERING ROOF
(u7 that the top story of the building should be right
inside the roof, surrounded by it.
Obviously, if there is habitable space inside the roof, it must
have some kind of windows; skylights are not satisfactory as windows-
except in studios or workshops-because they do not create
a connection between the inside and the outside world-WINDOWS
OVERLOOKINGL IFE 2).
It is therefore natural to pierce the roof with windows; in
short, to build dormer windows. This simple, fundamental fact
would hardly need mentioning if it were not for the fact that
dormer windows have come to seem archaic and romantic. It is
important to emphasize how sensible and ordinary they aresimply
because people may not build them if they believe that
they are old fashioned and out of date.
Dormers make the roof livable. Aside from bringing in light
and air and the connection to the outside, they relieve the low
ceilings along the edge of the roofs and create alcoves and window
places.
How should the dormers be constructed? Within the roof
vault we have described, the basket which forms the vault can
simply be continued to form the roof of the dormer, over a
frame of columns and perimeter beams which form the opening.
The other ways of building dormer windows depend on the
construction system you are using. Whatever you are using for lintels,
columns, and walls, can simply be modified and used in combination
to build the dormer.

 I DORMER WINDOWS

Wherever you have windows in the roof, make dormer

... and this pattern finishes the ROOF GARDENS II  or the
ROOF VAULTS 20). Assume that you have built the roof vaults
-or at least that yon have started to build up the splines which
will support the cloth which forms the vault. Or assume that you
have begun to build a roof garden, and have begun to fence it or
surround it. In either case-how shall the roof be finished?
There are few cases in traditional architecture where
builders have not used some roof detail to cap the building
with an ornament.
The pediments on Greek buildings; the caps on the trulli of
Alberobello; the top of Japanese shrines; the venting caps on
barns. In each of these examples there seems to be some issue
of the building system that needs resolution, and the builder
takes the opportunity to make a "cap."
We suspect there is a reason for th is which should be taken
seriously. The roof cap helps to finish the building; it tops the
building with a human touch. Yet, the power of the cap, its
overall effect on the feeling of the building, is of much greater
proportions than one would expect. Look ;it these sketches of a
building, with and without a roof cap. They look like different
buildings. The difference is enormous.
Wit!t and wit!tout a roof cap.
Why is it that these caps are so important and have such a
powerful effect on the building as a whole?
Here are some possible reasons.
I. They crown the roof. They give the roof the status that
it deserves. The roof is important, and the caps emphasize this
fact.
 They add detail. They make the roof less homogeneous, and
I 085

they relieve the roof from being a single uninterrupted thing.
The walls get this relief from windows, doors, balconies, which
add scale and character; when a roof has many dormers, it seems
to need the caps less.
 The caps provide a connection to the sky, in a way that
might have had religious overtones at one time. Just as the building
needs a sense of connection to the earth-see CONNECTION
To THE EARTH  )-perhaps the roof needs a connection to
the sky.
In the building system we propose, the roof caps are weights
we use at the ridge of the roof to make the slight curve in the
pitched sides of the roof. They happen at regular intervals, at
the ridges of the scallops. They need not be large-a small bag
of sand or a stone will do, plastered with concrete and shaped so
the bulge is obvious. It may be nice to paint them a different
color from the roof.
Of course, there are hundreds of other possible kinds of roof
caps. They can be brick chimneys, statues, vents, structural
details, the pinnacles on a gothic buttress, weather vanes, or even
windmills.
Therefore:
Choose a natural way to cap the roof-some way which
is in keeping with the kind of construction, and the meaning
of the building. The caps may be structural; but their
main function is decorative-they mark the top-they
mark the place where the roof penetrates the sky.

help intensify the gradient of intimacy in the buildingINTIMACY
GRAOIENT ).

We want the floor to be comfortable, warm to the touch,
inviting. But we also want it to be hard enough to resist
wear, and easy to clean.
When we think of floors, we think of wood floors. We hope,
if we can afford it, to have a wooden floor. Even in hot countries,
where tiles are beautiful, many people want hardwood floors
whenever they can afford them. But the wood floor, though it
seems so beautiful, does little to solve the fundamental problem
of floors. The fact is that a room in which there is a bare wood
floor, seems rather barren, forbidding, makes the room sound
hollow and unfurnished. To make the wooden floor nice, we put
down carpets. But then it is not really a wood floor at all. This
confusion makes it clear that the fundamental problem of "the
floor" has not been properly stated.
When we look at the problem honestly, we realize that the
wooden floor, and the wooden floor with a carpet on it, are both
rather uneven compromises. The bare wooden floor is too bare,
too hard to be comfortable; but not in fact hard enough to resist
wear particularly well if it is left uncovered-it scratches and
dents and splinters. And when the floor is covered with a
carpet, the whole point of the beauty of the wood is lost. You
cannot see it any more, except round the edges of the carpet;
and the carpet on the floor is certainly not hard enough to resist
any substantial wear. Furthermore, the most beautiful carpets,
handmade rugs and tapestries, are so delicate that they cannot
take very rough wear. The practice of walking on a Persian rug
with outdoor shoes on is a barbarian habit, never practiced by the
people who make those rugs, and know how to treat them-they
always take their shoes off. But the modern nylon and acrylic
rugs, machine-made for hard wear, lose all the sumptuousness and
CONSTRUCTION
pleasure of the carpet: they are, as it were, soft kinds of concrete.
The problem cannot be solved. The conflict is fundamental.
The problem can only be avoided by making a clear distinction
in the house between those areas which have heavy traffic and
so need hard wearing surfaces which are easy to clean, and those
other areas which have only very light traffic, where people can
take off their shoes, and where lush, soft, beautiful rugs, pillows,
and tapestries can easily be spread.
Traditional Japanese houses and Russian houses solve the problem
in exactly this way: they divide the floor into two zonesserviceable
and comfortable. They use very clean, and often precious
materials in the comfortable zone, and often make the serviceable
zone an extension of the street-that is, dirt, paving, and
so on. People take their shoes off, or put them on, when they pass
from one zone to the other.

The threshold between hard and soft.
We are not sure whether taking shoes off and on could become
a natural habit in our culture. But it still makes sense to zone the
house so that the floor material changes as one gets deeper into
the house. The pattern INTIMACY GRADIENT  I   calls for a
gradient of public, semi-public, and private rooms. It follows that
one wants the floor to get softer as one goes deeper into the
house-that is, the entrance and the kitchen are better floored
with a hard, serviceable surface, while the dining, family room,
and children's playrooms need a serviceable floor but with comfortable
spots, and the bedrooms, studies, rooms of one's own
need soft comfortable floors, on which people can sit, lie, and walk
barefoot.
 FLOOR SURFACE
What should the materials be? Of the hard and soft materials,
the hard is more of a problem. Since children are close to these
floors, as well as the soft ones, they must be warm to the touch,
-and at the same time they must be easy to clean. For these hard
floors, a "soft" concrete might work. It can be made serviceable
and pleasant at the same time if it is finished off with a lightweight
textured floor finish, which is relatively porous. It can be
made to wear and repel water by making the color integral with
the mix and by waxing and polishing after it is set. It is fairly
cheap and makes sense if the floor is a concrete floor anyway.
Other materials which would work as hard floors are earth, rubber
or cork tile, soft unbaked tile known as pastelleros in Peru-see
SOFT TILE AND BRICK )-and wood planks, but these materials
are more expensive.
For soft materials, carpet is the most satisfactory-for sitting,
lying, and being close to the ground. We doubt that an improvement
can be made on it-in fact we guess that if a substitute is
used instead, it will eventually get carpeted over, anyway. This
means that the areas which are going to be carpeted might as
well have a cheap subfloor with matting laid wall to wall.
To emphasize the two zones, and to promote the taking off
and on of shoes from one zone to the next, we suggest that there
be a step up or a step down between the zones. This will help
tremendously in keeping each zone "pure," and it is sure to help
the activities in each zone.
Therefore:
Zone the house, or building, into two kinds of zones:
public zones, and private or more intimate zones. Use
hard materials like waxed, red polished concrete, tiles, or
hardwood in the public zones. In the more intimate zone,
use an underfloor of soft materials, like felt, cheap nylon
carpet, or straw matting, and cover it with cloths, and pillows,
and carpets, and tapestries. Make a clearly marked
edge between the two-perhaps even a step-so that people
can take their shoes off when they pass from the public to
the intimate.

 LAPPED OUTSIDE WALLS

... this pattern finishes the WALL MEMBRANES 18), and ROOF
VAULTS 20). It defines the character of their outside surfaces.

The main function of a building's outside wall is to keep
weather out. It can only do this if the materials are joined
in such a way that they cooperate to make impervious
joints.
At the same time, the wall must be easy to maintain; and give
the people outside some chance of relating to it.
None of these functions can be very well managed by great
sheets of impervious material. These sheets, always in the same
plane, have tremendous problems at the joints. They reguire
highly complex, sophisticated gaskets and seals, and, in the end,
it is these seals and joints which fail.
Consider a variety of natural organisms: trees, fish, animals.
Broadly speaking, their outside coats are rough, and made of
large numbers of similar but not identical elements. And these
elements are placed so that they often overlap: the scales of a fish,
the fur of an animal, the crinkling of natural skin, the bark of a
tree. All these coats are made to be impervious and easy to repair.
In simple technologies, buildings follow suit. Lapped boards,
shingles, hung tiles, thatch, are all examples. Even stone and
brick though in one plane, are still in a sense lapped internally to
prevent cracks which run all the way through. And all of these
walls are made of many small elements, so that individual pieces
can be replaced as they are damaged or wear out.
Bear in mind then, as you choose an exterior wall finish, that
it should be a material which can be easily lapped against the
weather, which is made of elements that are easy to repair locally,
and which therefore can be maintained piecemeal, indefinitely.
And of course, whatever you choose, mak.! it a surface which invites
you to touch it and lean up against it.
In making our filled lightweight concrete structures, we have

used lapped boards as the exterior formwork for the lightweight
concrete fill. And it is, of course, possible to use many other kinds
of external cladding if they are available and if one can afford
them. Slate, corrugated iron, ceramic tiles will produce excellent
shingled wall claddings, and can all be placed in such a way as to
provide exterior form work for the pouring of a wall. It is also
conceivable  though we have no evidence for it), that scientists
might be able to create an oriented material whose internal crystal
or fiber structure is in effect "lapped," because all the split lines
run diagonally outward and downward.
Therefore:
Build up the exterior wall surface with materials that are
lapped against the weather: either "internally lapped," like
exterior plaster, or more literally lapped, like shingles and
boards and tiles. In either case, choose a material that is
easy to repair in little patches, inexpensively, so that little
by little, the wall can be maintained in good condition
indefinitely.

 SOFT INSIDE WALLS*
, .. and this pattern finishes the inner surface of the WALL
MEMBRANES 18), and the under surface of FLOOR-CEILING
VAULTS 19). If it is possible to use a soft material for the inner
sheet of the wall membrane, then the wall will have the right
character built in from the beginning.

A wall which is too hard or too cold or too solid is unpleasant
to touch; it makes decoration impossible, and
creates hollow echoes.
A very good material is soft white gypsum plaster. It is warm
in color  even though white), warm to the touch, soft enough to
take tacks and nails and hooks, easy to repair, and makes a
mellow sound, because its sound absorption capacity is reasonably
high.
However, cement plaster, though only slightly different-and
even confused with gypsum plaster-is opposite in all of these
respects. It is too hard to nail into comfortably; it is cold and
hard and rough to the touch; it has very low absorption acoustically-
that is, very high reflectance-which creates a harsh, hollow
sound; and it is relatively hard to repair, because once a
crack forms in it, it is hard to make a repair that is homogeneous
with tl1e original.
In general, we have found that modern construction has gone
more and more toward materials for inside walls that are hard
and smooth. This is partly an effort to make buildings clean and
impervious to human wear. But it is also because the kinds of materials
used today are machine made-each piece perfect and
exactly the same.
Buildings made of these flawless, hard and smooth surfaces
leave us totally unrelated to them. We tend to stay away from
them not only because they are psychologically strange, but because
in fact they are physically uncomfortable to lean against;
they have no give; they don't respond to us.

CONSTRUCTION
The solution to the problem lies in the following:
I. Gypsum plaster as opposed to cement plaster. Soft baked
tiles as opposed to hard fired ones. When materials are porous
and low in density they are generally softer and warmer to the
touch.
 Use materials which are granular and have natural texture,
and which can be used in small pieces, or in such a way that there
is repetition of the same small element. Walls finished in wood
have the quality-the wood itself has texture; boards repeat it
at a larger scale. Plaster has this character when it is hand finished.
First there is the granular quality of the plaster and then the
larger texture created by the motion of the human hand.
One of the most beautiful versions of this pattern is the one
used in Indian village houses. The walls are plastered, by hand,
with a mixture of cow dung and mud, which dries to a beautiful
soft finish and shows the five fingers of the plasterer's hand all
over the walls.

Therefore:
Make every inside surface warm to the touch, soft
enough to take small nails and tacks, and with a certain
slight "give" to the touch. Soft plaster is very good; textile
hangings, canework, weavings, also have this character.
And wood is fine, where you can afford it.

 WINDOWS WHICH
OPEN WIDE*

... this pattern helps to complete WINDOW PLACE  I 0), WINDows
OVERLOOKING LIFE  I 2)' and NATURAL DOORS AND WINDOWS
(  I).
Many buildings nowadays have no opening windows at
all; and many of the opening windows that people do
build, don't do the job that opening windows ought to do.
It is becoming the rule in modern design to seal up windows
and create "perfect" indoor climates with mechanical air conditioning
systems. This is crazy.
A window is your connection ro the outside. It is a source of
fresh air; a simple way of changing the temperature, quickly,
when the room gets too hot or too cold; a place to hang out and
smell the air and trees and flowers and the weather; and a hole
through. which people can talk to each other.
What is the best kind of window?
Double-hung windows cannot be fully opened-only half of
the total window area can ever be opened at once. And they often
get stuck-sometimes because they have been painted, sometimes
because their concealed operating system of cords, counter-weights,
and pulleys gets broken; it becomes such an effort to open them
that no one bothers.
Sliding windows have much of the same problem-only part of
the window area can be open, since one panel goes behind
another; and they often get stuck too.
The side hung casement is easy to open and close. It gives
the greatest range of openings, and so creates the greatest degree
of control over air and temperature; and it makes an opening
which is large enough to put your head and shoulders through.
It is the easiest window to climb in and out of too.
The old time French windows are a stunning example of this
pattern. They are narrow, full length upstairs windows, which
swing out onto a tiny balcony, large enough only to contain the
open windows. When you open them you fill the frame, and can
stand drinking in the air: they put you intensely close to the out-
I IOI
CONSTRUCTION
side-yet in a perfectly urban sense, as much in Paris or Madrid
as in the open countryside.
Therefore:
Decide which of the windows will be opening windows.
Pick those which are easy to get to, and choose the ones
which open onto Rowers you want to smell, paths where
you might want to talk, and natural breezes. Then put in
side-hung casements that open outward. Here and there, go
all the way and build full French windows.

... this pattern finishes the doors defined by CORNER DOORS
(196 and LOW DOORWAY 24). It also helps to finish TAPESTRY
OF LIGHT AND DARK    and INTERIOR WINDOWS  4), since it
requires glazing in the doors, and can help to create daylight in
the darker parts of indoor places.

An opaque door makes sense in a vast house or palace,
where every room is large enough to be a world unto itself;
but in a small building, with small rooms, the opaque door
is only very rarely useful.
What is needed is a kind of door which gives some sense of
visual connection together with the possibility of acoustic isolation:
a door which you can see through but can't hear through.
Glazed doors have been traditional in certain periods-they are
beautiful, and enlarge the sense of connection and make the life
in the house one, but still leave people the possibility of privacy
they need. A glazed door allows for a more graceful entrnnce into
a room and for a more graceful reception by people in the room,
because it allows both parties to get ready for each other. It also
allows for different degrees of privacy: You can leave the door
open, or you can shut it for acoustical privacy but maintain the
visual connection; or you can curtain the window for visual and
acoustic privacy. And, most important, it gives the feeling that
everyone in the building is connected-not isolated in private
rooms.
Therefore:
As often as possible build doors with glazing in them,
so that the upper half at least, allows you to see through
them. At the same time, build the doors solid enough, so

that they give acoustic isolation and make a comfortable

   FILTERED LIGHT*

... even if the windows are beautifully placed, glare can still be
a problem-NATURAL DOORS AND WIN Dows   I). The softness
of the light, in and around the window, makes an enormous
difference to the room inside. The shape of the frames can do a
part of it-DEEP REVEALS 23)-but it still needs additional
help.

Light filtered through leaves, or tracery, s wonderful.
But why?
We know that light filtering through a leafy tree is very
pleasant-it lends excitement, cheerfulness, gaiety; and we know
that areas of uniform lighting create dull, uninteresting spaces.
But why?
I. The most obvious reason: direct light coming from a point
source casts strong shadows, resulting in harsh images with strong
contrasts. And people have an optical habit which makes this contrast
worse: our eye automatically reinforces boundaries so that
they read sharper than they are. For example, a color chart with
strips of different colors set next to each other will appear as
though there are dark lines between the strips. These contrasts
and hard boundaries are unpleasant-objects appear to have a
hard character, and our eyes, unable to adjust to the contrast,
cannot pick up the details.
For all these reasons, we have a natural desire to diffuse light
with lamp shades or indirect lighting, so that the images created
by the light will be "softer," that is, that the boundaries perceived
are not sharp, there is less contrast, fewer shadows, and the details
are easier to see. This is also why photographers use reflected
light instead of direct light when photographing objects; they
pick up details which otherwise would be lost in shadow.
 The second reason: to reduce the glare around the window.
When there is bright light coming in through the window, it
creates glare against the darkness of the wall around the window
-see DEEP REVEALS 23). Filtering the light especiaJly at the
I 06
 FILTERED LIGHT
edges of the window cuts down the glare by letting in less
light.
 A third reason which is pure conjecture: it may simply be
that an object which has small scale patterns of light dancing on
it is sensually pleasing, and stimulates us biologically. Some filmmakers
claim the play of light upon the retina is naturally sensuous,
all by itself.
To create filtered light, partially cover those windows which
get direct sunlight, with vines and lattices. Leaves are special
because they move. And the edge of the window can have fine
tracery-that is, the edge of the glass itself, not the frame, so
that the light coming in is gradually stronger from the edge to
the center of the window; the tracery is best toward the top of
the window where the light is strongest. Many old windows
combine these ideas.
Therefore:
Where the edge of a window or the overhanging eave of
a roof is silhouetted against the sky, make a rich, detailed
taspestry of light and dark, to break up the light and
soften it.

You can do this, most easily, with climbing plants trained to
climb around the outside of the window-CLIMBING PLANTS
( ). If there are no plants, you can also do it beautifully with
simple canvas awnings-CANVAS ROOFS  4), perhaps coloredWARM
COLORS 0). You can also help to filter light by making
the panes smaller, more delicate, and more elaborate high in the
window where the light is strong-SMALL PANES   ).

When plate glass windows became possible, people
thought that they would put us more directly in touch
with nature. In fact, they do the opposite.
They alienate us from the view. The smaller the windows are,
and the smaller the panes are, the more intensely windows help
connect us with what is on the other side.
This is an important paradox. The clear plate window seems
as though it ought to bring nature closer to us, just because it
seems to be more like an opening, more like the air. But, in fact,
our contact with the view, our contact with the things we see
through windows is affected by the way the window frames them.
When we consider a window as an eye through which to see a
view, we must recognize that it is the extent to which the window
frames the view, that increases the view, increases its intensity,
increases its variety, even increases the number of views we seem
to see-and it is because of this that windows which are broken
into smaller windows, and windows which are filled with tiny
panes, put us so intimately in touch with what is on the other
side. It is because they create far more frames: and it is the multitude
of frames which makes the view.
Thomas Markus, who has studied windows extensively, has
arrived at the same conclusion: windows which are broken up
make for more interesting views. "The Function of WindowsA
Reappraisal," Building Science, Vol. z, 67, pp. 01-4).
He points out that small and narrow windows afford different
views from different positions in the room, while the view tends
to be the same through large windows or horizontal ones.
We believe that the same thing, almost exactly, happens
I !09
CONSTRUCTION
within the window frame itself. The following picture shows
a simple landscape, broken up as it might be by six panes. Instead
of one view, we see six views. The view becomes alive
because the small panes make it so.
Six views.
Another argument for small panes: Modern architecture and
building have deliberately tried to make windows less like
windows and more as though there was nothing between you and
the outdoors. Yet this entirely contradicts the nature of windows.
It is the function of windows to offer a view and provide a relationship
to the outside, true. But this does not mean that they
should not at the same time, like the walls and roof, give you a
sense of protection and shelter from the outside. It is uncomfortable
to feel that there is nothing between you and the outside,
when in fact you are inside a building. It is the nature of windows
to give you a relationship to the outside and at the same
time give a sense of enclosure.
Small panes in Mendocino.
I I IO
 SMALL PANES
Not only that. Big areas of clear glass are sometimes even
dangerous. People walk into plate glass windows, because they
look like air. By comparison, windows with small panes give a
clear functional message-the frames of the panes definitely tell
you that something is there separating you from the outside. And
they help to create FILTERED LIGHT ).
Therefore:
Divide each window into small panes. These panes can
be very small indeed, and should hardly ever be more than
a foot square. To get the exact size of the panes, divide
the width and height of the window by the number of
panes. Then each window will have different sized panes
according to its height and width.

Totalitarian, machine buildings do not require trim because
they are precise enough to do without. But they buy
their precision at a dreadful price: by killing the possibility
of freedom in the building plan.
A free and natural building cannot be conceived without the
possibility of finishing it with trim, to cover up the minor variations
which have arisen in the plan, and during its construction.
For example, when nailing a piece of gypsum board to a
column-if the board is cut on site-it is essential that the cut
can be inaccurate within a half-inch or so. If it has to be more
accurate, there will be a great waste of material, and on-site
cutting time and labor will increase, and, finally, the very possibility
of adapting each part of the building to the exact subtleties
of the plan and site will be in jeopardy.
It is in response to difficulties of this sort that modern system
building has arisen. Here tolerances are very low indeed-1/s
inch and even lower-and there is no need for trim to cover up
inaccuracies. However, the precision of the components can only
be obtained by the most tyrannical control over the plan. This
one aspect of construction has by itself destroyed the builder's
capacity to make a building which is natural, organic, and adapted
to the site.
If, as we suggest, the building procedure is looser and allows
much larger tolerance-even mistakes on the order of half an inch
or more-then the use of trim to cover the connection becween
materials becomes essential. Indeed, within this attitude to building,
the trim is not a trivial decoration added as a finishing
touch, but an essential phase of the construction. We see, then,
I l I
CONSTRUCTION
that trim, so often associated with older buildings, and treated as
an emblem of nostalgia, is in fact a vi ta] part of the process of
making buildings natural.
Finally, it is worth adding a note about the actual size of the
trim pieces. Buildings built in the last   years often make a
virtue out of boldness, and there is a tendency to use very large
oversized pieces of trim instead of small pieces. Within the
framework of this philosophy, it might seem right to use pieces
of trim  or  inches thick for their effect and heaviness. We
believe that this is wrong: Trim which is too large, or too
thick, doesn't do its job. This is not a matter of style. There is a
psychological reason for making sure that every component in the
building has at least some pieces of trim which are of the order
of half an inch or an inch thick, anti no more.
Compare the following two examples of trim. For some reason
the right-hand one, in which the trim is finer, is closer and
better adapted to our feelings than the left-hand one.
C!tunky trim

JLJJil
fine scale trim.
The reason for this seems to be the following. Our own bodies
and the natural surroundings in which we evolved contain a
continuous hierarchy of details, ranging all the way from the
molecular fine structure to gross features like arms and legs in
our own bodies and trunks and branches in our natural surroundings).
We know from results in cognitive psychology that any one step
in this hierarchy can be no more than :5, :7, or : ifwe are
to perceive it as a natural hierarchy. We cannot understand a
hierarchy in which there is a jump in scale of I : or more. It
is this fact which makes it necessary for our surroundings, even
when man-made, to display a similar continuum of detail.
Most materials have some kind of natural fibrous or crystalline
II

structure at the scale of about ½o inch. But if the smallest
building detail dimensions are of the order of  or  inches, this
leaves a jump of  : or I : between these details and the fine
structure of the material.
 n order to allow us to perceive a connection between tne fine
building construction and the fine structure of the materials, it is
essential that the smallest building details be of the order of a
half inch or so, so that it is no more than about IO times the size
of the granular and fibrous texture of the materials.
Therefore:
Wherever two materials meet, place a piece of trim over
the edge of the connection. Choose the pieces of trim so
that the smallest piece, in each component, is always of
the order of ½ inch wide. The trim can be wood, plaster,
terracotta. . ..

To make it perfectly complete you need to build in the details of

We made random spot checks on selected benches in Berkeley,
California, and recorded these facts about each bench: Was it
occupied or empty/ Did it give a view of current activity or not/
Was it in the sun or not/ What was the current wind velocity?
Three of the eleven benches were occupied; eight were empty.
At the moment of observation, all three occupied benches
looked onto activity, were in the sun, and had a wind velocity of
less than I.  feet per second. At the moment of observation, none
of the eight empty benches had all three of these characteristics.
Three of them had shelter and activity but no sun; three of
them had activity but no sun, and wind greater than  feet per
second; two of them had sun and shelter but no activity.
A second series of observations compared the numbers of old
people sitting in Union Square at  :oo P.M. on a sunny day with
the number at  :oo P.M. on a cloudy day:  people on the
sunny day and  I on the cloudy day, even though the air temperature
was the same on both days.

Therefore:
Choosing good spots for outdoor seats is far more important
than building fancy benches. Indeed, if the spot
is right, the most simple kind of seat is perfect.
In cool climates, choose them to face the sun, and to be
protected from the wind; in hot climates, put them in shade
and open to summer breezes. In both cases, place them to

People like to watch the street.
But they do not always want a great deal of involvement with
the street. The process of hanging out requires a continuum of
degrees of involvement with the street, ranging all the way from
the most private kind to the most public kind. A young girl
watching the street may want to be able to withdraw the moment
anyone looks at her too intently. At other times people may want
to be watching the street, near enough to it to talk to someone
who comes past, yet still protected enough so that they can withdraw
into their own domain at a moment's notice,
The most public kind of involvement with the street is sitting
out. Many people, especially older people, pull chairs out to the
front door or lean against the front of their houses, either while

they are working at something or just for the pleasure of watching
street life. But since there is some reluctance to be too public,
this activity requires a bench or seat which is clearly private,
even though in the public world. It is best of all when the
bench is placed so that people are sitting on the edge of their
world on private land-yet so placed that the personal space it
creates overlaps with land that is legally public.
Therefore:
Build a special bench outside the front door where
people from inside can sit comfortably for hours on end
and watch the world go by. Place the bench to define a
half-private domain in front of the house. A low wall, planting,
a tree, can help to create the same domain.

 SITTING WALL**

•.. if all is well, the outdoor areas are largely made up of
positive spaces-POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACES  I 06); in some fashion
you have marked boundaries between gardens and streets, between
terraces and gardens, between outdoor rooms and terraces, between
play areas and gardens-GREEN STREETS   I), PEDESTRIAN
STREET  I 00), HALF-HIDDEN CARDEN  I 1), HIERARCHY OF

(124), PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET 0), OUTDOOR
ROOM 3), OPENING TO THE STREET 5), CALLERY SURROUND
(166), CARDEN CROWING WILD 2). With this pattern,
you can help these natural boundaries take on their proper character,
by building walls, just low enough to sit on, and high
enough to mark the boundaries.
If you have also marked the places where it makes sense to
build seats-SEAT SPOTS 1), FRONT DOOR BENCH 2)-you
can kill two birds with one stone by using the walls as seats which
help enclose the outdoor space wherever its positive character is
weakest.

In many places walls and fences between outdoor spaces
are too high; but no boundary at all does injustice to the
subtlety of the divisions between the spaces.
Consider, for example, a garden on a quiet street. At least
somewhere along the edge between the two there is a need for a
seam, a place which unites the two, but does so without breaking
down the fact that they are separate places. If there is a high
wall or a hedge, then the people in the garden have no way
of being connected to the street; the people in the street have
no way of being connected to the garden. But if there is no
barrier at all-then the division between the two is hard to
maintain. Stray dogs can wander in and out at will; it is even
uncomfortable to sit in the garden, because it is essentially like
sitting in the street.
Il25
CONSTRUCTION
T lie problem can only be solved by a kind of barrier which
fimctions as a ba1'1'ier which separatts, and as a seam which joins,
at the same time.
A low wall or balustrade, just at the right height for sitting,
is perfect. It creates a barrier which separates. But because it invites
people to sit on it-invites them to sit first with their legs
on one side, then with their legs on top, then to swivel round
still further to the other side, or to sit astride it-it also functions
as a seam, which makes a positive connection between the two
places.
Examples: A low wall with the children's sandbox on one side,
circulation path on the other; low wall at the front of the garden,
connecting the house to the public path; a sitting wall that is a
retaining wall, with plants on one side, where people can sit
close to the flowers and eat their lunch.
Rnskin describes a sitting wall he experienced:
Last summer I was lodging for a little while in a cottage in the
country, and in front of my low window there were, first, some beds
of daisies, then a row of gooseberry and currant bushes, and then
a low wall about three feet above the ground, covered with stonecress.
Outside, a com-field, with its green ears glistening in the sun,
and a field path through it, just past the garden gate. From my
window I could see every peasant of the village who passed that
way, with basket on arm for market, or spade on shoulder for field.
When I was inclined for society, I could lean over my wall, and
talk fo anybody; when I was inclined for science, I could botanize
all along the top of my wall-there were four species of stone-cress
alone growing  it; and when I was inclined for exercise, I could
jump over my wall, backwards and forwards. That's the sort of
fence to have in a Christian country; not a thing which you can't
walk inside of without making yourself look like a wild beast, nor
look at out of your window in the morning without expecting to
see somebody impaled upon it in the night. John Ruskin, T!te Two
Paths, New York: Everyman's Library, 07, p. :io3.)
Therefore:
Surround any natural outdoor area, and make minor
boundaries between outdoor areas with low walls, about
 inches high, and wide enough to sit on, at least
inches wide.

 CANVAS ROOFS*

OUTDOOR ROOMS  3), GALLERY SURROUNDS  I 6), TRELLISED
WALKS 4), and WINDOW PLACES 0), even SMALL PARKING
LOTS  03), which all become more subtle and more beautiful
with canvas roofs and awnings. And the awnings always help to
create FILTERED LIGHT    ).
There is a very special beauty about tents and canvas
awnings. The canvas has a softness, a suppleness, which is
in harmony with wind and light and sun. A house or
any building built with some canvas will touch all the elements
more nearly than it can when it is made only with
hard conventional materials.
In conventional building, it is easy to think that walls and
roofs must either be solid, or missing altogether. But cloth and
canvas lie just exactly halfway in between. They are translucent,
let a little breeze pass through, and they are very cheap, and easy
to roll up and easy to pull down.
We can identify three kinds of places that need these properties:
I. Awnings-sunshades over windows, retractable, and used to
filter very bright hot sunlight.
 Curtains-moveable, half-open walls on outdoor rooms, balconies,
and galleries-places that are occupied mainly during the
day, but might benefit from extra wind protection.
 Tent-like roofs on outdoor rooms-a tent which can hold
off a drizzle and make outdoor rooms, or trellises, or courtyards
habitable in the spring and autumn and at night.
Here is Frank Lloyd Wright describing his use of the canvas
roof in the very early structures at Taliesin West:
... the Taliesin Fellowship  is a desert camp on a great Arizona
mesa which the boys, together with myself, are now building to
work and live in during the winter-time. Many of the building units
have canvas tops carried by red-wood framing resting on massive

CONSTRUCTION
stone walls made by placing the flat desert stones into wood boxes
and throwing in stones and concrete behind them. Most of the canvas
frames ,nay be opened or kept closed .... The canvas overhead
being translucent, there is a very beautiful light to live and work in;
I have experienced nothing like it elsewhere except in Japan somewhat,
in their houses with sliding· paper walls or "shoji." The
Future of Arcl,itectllre, London: The Architectural Press, 55, pp.
z55-56.)
Another example: In Italy, the canvas awning s used quite
commonly as a simple awning over south and west windows. The
canvas is often a bright and beautiful orange, giving color to the
street and a warm glow to the interior rooms.
As a final example, we report on our own use of this pattern
in the housing project in Lin1J. We roofed interior patios with
mov.1ble c;mvas material. In hot weather the covers arc rolled back,
and a breeze blows through the house. In cold weather, the
canvas is rolled out, sealing the house, and the patio is still
useful. In Lima, there is a winter dew which normally makes
patio floors damp and cold for eight months in the year. The
cover on the patios keeps them dry rnd warm and triples their
useful life. They eliminate the need for glass windows almost
entirely. The windows which look into patios give light to rooms
and may be curtained for visual control-but since the cold and
damp are kept  by the patio canvas there need be no glass
 the windows and no expensive moving parts.

 RAISED FLOWERS*

... outdoors there are various low walls at sitting heightSITTING
WALL 3); terraced gardens, if the garden has a natural
slope in it-TERRACED SLOPE  I ); and paths and steps
and crinkled building edges-PATHS AND GOALS   0), STAIR
SEATS ), BUILDING EDGE 0), GARDEN WALL 3).
These are the best spots for flowers, and flowers help to make
them beautiful.
Flowers are beautiful along the edges of paths, buildings,
outdoor rooms-but it is just in these places that they
need the most protection from traffic. Without some protection
they cannot easily survive.
Look at the positions that wildflowers take in nature. They
are as a rule in protected places when they occur in massive guanti
ties: places away from traffic-often on grassy banks, on corners
of fields, against a wall. It is not natural for flowers to grow in
bundles like flower beds; they need a place to nestle.
What are the issues?
 The sun-they need plenty of sun.
 A position where people can smell and touch them.
 Protection from stray animals.
 A position where people see them, either from inside a
house or along the paths which they naturally pass coming and
going.
Typical flower borders are often too deep and too exposed.
And they arc so low the flowers arc out of reach. Concrete
planter boxes made to protect flowers often go to the other extreme.
They are so protected that people have no contact with
them, except from a distance. This is next to useless. The flowers
need to be close, where you can touch them, smell them.
Therefore, instead of putting the flowers in low borders, on
the ground, where people walk, or in massive concrete tubs, build
them up in low beds, with sitting walls beside them, along the
sides of paths, around entrances and edges. Make guite certain
I I

that the flowers are placed in positions where people really can
enjoy them-and not simply as ornamen:: outside favorite windows,
along traveled paths, ne;ir entrances and round doorways,
by outdoor seats.
Raised flowers.
Therefore:
Soften the edges of buildings, paths, and outdoor areas
with flowers. Raise the flower beds so that people can
touch the flowers, bend to smell them, and sit by them.
And build the Rower beds with solid edges, so that people
can sit on them, among the flowers too.
I I
CLIMBING PLANTS
... two earlier patterns can be helped by climbing plants
around the building: TRELLISED WALK  I   and FILTERED
LIGHT ).

A building finally becomes a part of its surroundings
when the plants grow over parts of it as freely as they
grow along the ground.
There is no doubt that buildings with roses or vines or honeysuckle
growing on them mean much more to us than buildings
whose walls are blank and bare. That is reason enough to plant
wild clematis around the outside of a building, to make boxes to
encourage plants to grow at higher storys, and to make frames
and trellises for them to climb on. ·
We can think of four ways to ground this intuition in function.
 One argument, consistent with others in the book, is that
climbing plants effect a smooth transition between the built and
the natural. A sort of blurring of the edges.
 The quality of light. When the plants grow around the
openings of buildings, they create a special kind of filtered light
inside. This light is soft, reduces glare, and stark shadowsFILTERED
LIGHT ),
 The sense of touch. Climbing and hanging plants also give
the outside walls a close and subtle texture. The same kind of
texture can be achieved in the building materials, but it is
uniquely beautiful when it comes from a vine growing across a
wall or winding around the eaves of an arcade. Then, the texture
invites you to touch and smell it, to pick off a leaf. Perhaps most
important, the texture of climbing plants is ever different; it is
subtly different from day to day, as the wind and sun play upon
it; and it is greatly different from season to season.
 Tending the plants. When they are well-tended, healthy
plants and flowers growing around the windows and out of
flower boxes in the upper storys, make the street feel more

 CLIMBING PLANTS
comfortable. They bespeak a social order of some repose within
the buildings, and therefore it is comfortable to be on the streets
 one feels at home. It is as if the plants were a gift from the
people inside to people on the street.
The contrib11tion to the street.
Therefore:
On sunny walls, train climbing plants to grow up round
the openings in the wall-the windows, doors, porches,
arcades, and trellises.

 PAVING WITH CRACKS
BETWEEN THE STONES**
... many patterns call for paths and terraces and places where
the outdoor areas around a building feel connected to the
earth-GREEN STREETS 1), PATH SHAPE 1), PRIVATE
TERRACE ON THE STREET  I 0), OUTDOOR ROOM  I  ), CONNECTION
TO THE EARTH ), TERRACED SLOPE ). This
pattern provides a way of building the ground surface that makes
these larger patterns come to life.
Asphalt and concrete surfaces outdoors are easy to wash
down, but they do nothing for us, nothing for the paths,
and nothing for the rainwater and plants.
Look at a simple path, made by laying bricks or paving stones
directly in the earth, with ample cracks between the stones. It is
good to walk on, good for the plants, good for the passage of
time, good for the rain. You walk from stone to stone, and feel
the earth directly under foot. It does not crack, because as the
earth settles, the stones move with the earth and gradually take
on a rich uneven character. As time goes by, the very age and
history of all the moments on that path are almost recorded in
its slight unevenness. Plants and mosses and small flowers grow between
the cracks. The cracks also help preserve the delicate
ecology of worms and insects and beetles and the variety of plant
species. And when it rains, the water goes directly to the ground;
there is no concentrated run-off, no danger of erosion, no loss
of water in the ground around the path.
All these are good reasons to set paving stones loosely. As for
the flat, smooth, hard concrete and asphalt surfaces, they have
almost nothing to recommend them. They are built when people
forget these small advantages that come about when paving s
made out of individual stones with cracks between the stones.
Therefore:
On paths and terraces, lay paving stones with a I inch
crack between the stones, so that grass and mosses and

How can a person feel the earth, or time, or any connection
with his surroundings, when he is walking on the
hard mechanical wash-easy surfaces of concrete, asphalt,
hard-fired architectural paving bricks, or artificially concocted
mixes like terrazo.
It is essential, above all, that the ground level surfaces we
walk on-both around our buildings and indoors in those places
like passages and kitchens where the floor has to be hard-be soft
enough, at least, to show the passage of time, in gradual undulations
and unevenness, that tell the story of a thousand passing
feet, and make it clear that buildings are like people-not
impervious and alien, but alive, changing with time, remembering
the paths which people tread.
Nothing shows the passage of time so well as very soft, baked
or lightly fired, bricks and tiles. They are among the cheapest
tiles that can be made; they use ordinary clay, are biodegradable,
and always develop a beautiful sense of wear and time in
the undulations made by people walking over them.
In addition, those paved areas around a building required by
CONNECTION TO THE EARTH   play a special role. They are
the places which are halfway between the building-with its
artificial materials-and the earth-which is entirely natural.
To make this connection felt, the materials themselves must also
be halfway, in character, between the building and the earth.
Again, soft, lightly fixed tiles are most appropriate.
I I 1
CONSTRUCTION
We consider this so important, that we advocate, specifically,
that the people who are making the building, make the guantity
of bricks and tiles they need for ground floor and outdoor surfaces-
and that these be made in local clay and soft fired, in
stacks, right on the site.
It is easy to do. We shall now give detailed instructions for
making the tiles themselves and for making a rudimentary outdoor
firing pit.
We start with the clay: it would be best to make one's own
clay from scratch.
Clay is decomposed feldspathic rock. There is an abundance of it
all over the earth. One may be fortunate enough to find it in one's
back yard.
To test whether it is clay, pick up a bit of it and wet it. If it is
plastic and sticky enough to form a smooth ball, it is clay ....
Process the clay as follows:
 First, remove impurities such as twigs, leaves, roots and stones.
 Then, let the chunks dry in the sun.
 Break up these chunks and grind them up as finely as possible.
 Put this ground-up clay in water so that there is a mound
above water.
 Let this mixture soak for one day, then stir it, and sieve it
through a screen,
 Let stand again for another day, and remove excess water.
 Then put the clay in a plaster container; plaster absorbs water,
thus stiffening the mixtme into workable clay,
&. Work the clay a little to test it. If cracks appear, it is "short";
when that happens, add to the mixture, up to % bentonite. If
clay is too plastic, add "grog." ...
Shrinkage may be decreased by adding flint or grog to the clay.
Grog is clay that has been biscuit-fired and then crushed, Some
people prepare their own grog from broken biscuit-fired pieces. It
can be bought at very little cost at any supply company in varying
degrees of fineness. The coarser the particles of grog added to the
clay, the coarser the texture of the fired object will be.
Grog makes clay porous and is used for objects which are not
intended to hold water. Grog also prevents warpage and is, therefore,
very useful for tile making and for sculpture.  % is a good
proportion of grog in a clay mixture.
(Muriel Pargh Turoff, How to Make Pottery and Other Ceramic
Ware, New York: Crown Publishers, 49, p. .)
Once you have the clay, you can make the tiles.
In this method of tile making, a wooden form is used that has
the dimensions desired for the finished tiles. It is put together by

 SOFT TILE AND BRICK
nailing four strips of wood to a smooth piece of board. The strips
should be , inch wide and their height may vary from ¾ inch to
¾ inch, depending on how thick you wish the finished tiles to be.
It is a good plan to put a piece of oilcloth on the base board before
nailing down the strips. This will keep the board from warping ....
Roll out a slab of clay .... Then cut from the slab a piece that
will fit comfortably into the form and roll it down with a rolling
pin. Do not roll the pin all the way across the surface of the clay,
but work from the center outwards to all four sides .... Let the
tile dry until it is leather-hard; then separate it from the form by
running a knife around its edges ....
Clay tiles should be allowed to dry very slowly, and for this
reason should be put in a cool place. If they dry too quickly under
heat, they are apt to crack or warp. The edges have a tendency to
dry more rapidly than the center and usually should be dampened
from time to time to preve11t this. Joseph Leeming, Fun Witlt Clay,
Philadelphia and New York: J.B. Lippincott Company.)
To fire soft tiles and bricks, it is not necessary to build real
kilns. They can be fired in open pits much like those which
primitive potters used to fire their pottery. This type of open
pit firing is described in detail by Daniel Rhodes, in Kilns:
Design, Construction and Operation, Philadelphia: Chilton Book
Company. Briefly:
Dig a shallow pit about  to  inches deep, and several square
feet in area. Line this pit bottom and sides with branches, reeds,
twigs, etc. Place the tiles and bricks to be fired on the lining, so that
they are compactly piled with just a tiny bit of airspace between
them-( they can be criss-crossed .... If you use old tiles to
line the pit, it will keep the heat in even better; and air holes low
down at one end will help combustion .... Put some fuel in
between stacks and over them. Then light the fuel in the pit, and
allow it to burn slowly-which it will to begin with because not
much air can get to it. Pile more fuel on as the fire burns up to a
level above the pit. After the entire pit and its contents reach red
heat, allow the fire to die down, and cover the top of the fire with
wet leaves, dung or ashes to retain the heat. After the fire has
died down, and the embers cooled, the tiles can be removed.
A simple kiln.

Therefore:
Use bricks and tiles which are soft baked, low fired-so
that they will wear with time, and show the marks of use.
You can make them in a simple mold from local clay,
right on the site; surround the stack with twigs and firewood;
and fire them, to a soft pink color which will leave
them soft enough to wear with time.

touches, to fill the gaps, to mark the boundaries, by making
ornament.

All people have the instinct to decorate their surroundings.
But decorations and ornaments will only work when they are
properly made: for ornaments and decorations are not only born
from the natural exuberance and love for something happy in a
building; they also have a function, which. is as clear, and definite
as any other function in a building. The joy and exuberance of
carvings and color will only work, if they are made in harmony
with this function. And, further, the function is a necessary one
-the ornaments are not just optional additions which m:iy, or
may not be added to a building, according as the spirit moves
you-a building needs them, just as much as it needs doors and
windows.
In order to understand the function of ornament, we must begin
by understanding the nature of space in general. Space,
when properly formed, is whole. Every part of it, every part of a
town, a neighborhood, a building, a garden, or a room, is whole,
in the sense that it is both an integral entity, in itself, and at
the same time, joined to some other entities to form a larger
whole. This process hinges largely on the boundaries. lt is no
accident that so many of th.e patterns in this pattern language
concern the importance of the boundaries between things, as
places that are as important as the things themselves-for ex-

(225), HALF-INCH TRIM 0), SITTING WALL 3).
A thing is whole only when it is itself entire and also joined
to its outside to form a larger entity. But this can only
happen when the boundary between the two is so thick, so fleshy,
so ambiguous, that the two are not sharply separated, but can
function either as separate entities or as one larger whole which
has no inner cleavage in it.
Split ... and whole.
In the left-h:rnd diagram where there is a cleavage that is
sharp, the thing and its outside are distinct entities-they function
individually as wholes-but they do not function together ao
a larger whole. ln this case the world is split. In the right-hand
diagr;un where there is ambiguous space between them, the
two entities are individually entire, as before, but they are also
entire together as a larger whole. In this case the world is
whole.
This principle extends throughout the material universe, from
the largest organic structures in our surrotrndings, to the very
atoms and molecules.
Extreme examples of this principle at work in manmade
objects arc in the endless surfaces of obj ccts from the so-called
"dark ages" and in the carpets and tilework of Turkey and
Persia. Leaving aside the profound meaning of these "ornaments,"
it is a fact that they function mainly by creating surfaces
in which each part is simultaneously figure and boundary and
in which the design acts as boundary and figure at several different
levels simultaneously.

gs, rooms, anr! public spaces-is to ZJl{/ke the world more whole
by knitting it together in precisely the same way t!tis carpet
does it.
If the patterns in tl1is language are used correctly, then these
unifying boundaries will already come into existence without
ornament at almost all the scales where they are necessary in
spaces and materials. It will happen in the large spaces, like the
entrance transition or the building edge. And, of course, it happens
of its own accord, in those smaller structures which occur
within the materials themselves-in the libers of wood, in the
grain of brick and stone. But there is an intermediate range of
scales, a twilight zone, where it will not happen of its own accord.
It is in this range of scales that ornament fills the gap.
As far as specific ways of doing it are concerned, there are
hundreds, of course. In th s balustrade the ornament is made
entirely of the boundary, of the space between the boards. The
boards are cut in such a w.1y, that when they are joined together
in the fence, they make something of the space between
them.

... A balustrade.
Here is a more complicated case-the entrance to a Romanesque
church.
n A doorway.
The ornament is built up around the edge of the entrance. It
creates a unifying seam between the entrance space and the
stone. Without the ornament, there would be a gap between the
arch of the entry and the passage itself: the orn:iment works on the
seam, between the two, and holds them together. It is especially
lavish and developed in this place, because just this seam-the
boundary of the entrance to the church-is so important, symbolically,
to the people who worship there.
ln fact, doors and windows are always important for ornament,
because they are places of connection between the elements of
buildings and the life in and around them. It is very likely that
we shall find a concentration of ornament at the edges of doors
and windows, as people try to tie together these edges with the
space around them.
 ORNAMENT

And exactly the same happens at hundreds of other places in
the environment; in rooms, around our houses, in the kitchen, on
a wall, along the surface of a path, on tops of roofs, around a
column-in fact, anywhere at all where there are edges between
things which are imperfectly knit together, where materials or
objects meet, and where they change.
Early American stencilling.
Most generally of all, the thing that makes the difference in
the use of ornament is the eye for the significant gap in the continuum:
the place where the continuous fabric of interlock and
connectivity is broken. When ornament is applied badly it is
always put into some place where these connections are not really
missing, so it is superfluous, frivolous. When it is well used, it is
always applied in a place where there is a genuine gap, a need
for a little more structure, a need for what we may call metaphorically
"some extra binding energy," to knit the stuff together
where it is too much apart.
Therefore:
Search around the building, and find those edges and
transitions which need emphasis or extra binding energy.
CONSTRUCTION
Corners, places where materials meet, door frames, windows,
main entrances, the place where one wall meets another,
the garden gate, a fence-all these are natural places
which call out for ornament.
Now find simple themes and apply the elements of the
theme over and again to the edges and boundaries which
you decide to mark. Make the ornaments work as seams
along the boundaries and edges so that they knit the two
sides together and make them one.

 WARM COLORS**
... this pattern helps to create and generate the right kind
of GOOD MATERIALS  07), FLOOR SURFACE   ), SOFT INSIDE
WALLS ). Where possible leave the materials in their natural
state. Just add enough color for decoration, and to make the
light inside alive and warm.
The greens and greys of hospitals and office corridors
are depressing and cold. Natural wood, sunlight, bright
colors are warm. In some way, the warmth of the colors in
a room makes a great deal of difference between comfort
and discomfort.
But just what are warm colors and cold colors? In a very
simple minded sense, red and yellow and orange and brown are
warm; blue and green and grey are cold. But, obviously, it is not
true that rooms with red and yellow fee] good; while rooms
with blue and grey feel cold. There is some superficial truth to
this simple statement: it is true that reds and browns and
yellows lzelp to make rooms comfortable; but it is also true that
white and blue and green can all make people comfortable too.
After all, the sky is blue, and grass is green. Obviously, we feel
comfortable out in the green grass of a meadow, under the blue
sky.
The explanation is simple and fascinating. It is not the color of
the things, the surfaces, which make a place warm or cold, but
tlze color of tlze liglzt. What exactly does this mean? We can
estimate the color of the light at a particular point in space by
holding a perfectly white surface there. If the light is warm, this
surface will be slightly tinted toward the yellow-red. If the light
is cold, this surface will be slightly tinted toward the blue-green.
This tinting will be very slight: indeed, on a small white surface
it may be so hard to see that you need a spectrometer to do it.

CONSTRUCTION
But when you realize that everything in that space is lightly
tinted-people's faces, hands, shirts, dresses, food, paper, everything-
it is not so hard to see that this can have a huge effect on
the emotional quality that people experience there.
Now, the color of the light in a space does not depend in any
simple way on the color of the surface. It depends on a complex
interaction between the color of the light sources and the
way this light then bounces on and off the many surfaces. In a
meadow, on a spring day, the sunlight bouncing off the green
grass is still warm light-that is, in the yellowish reddish range.
The light in a hospital corridor, lit by fluorescent tubes, bouncing
off green walls is cold light-in the green-blue range. In a
room with lots of natural light, the overall light is warm. In a
room whose windows face onto a grey building across the street,
the light may be cold, unless there is a very strong concentration
of yellow and red fabrics.
If you are in any doubt about the objective character of the
light in the room and you don't have a spectrometer, all you need
to do is to try to use color film. If the light is warm and the film
is properly exposed, white walls will come out slightly pink. If the
light is cold, white walls will come out slightly blue.
So, in order to make a room comfortable, you must use a
collection of colors which together with the sources of light and
the reflecting surfaces outside the room, combine to make the
reflected light which exists in the middle of the room warm,
that is, toward the yelJow-red. Yellow and red colors will always
do it. Blues and greens and whites will only do it in the proper
places, balanced with other colors, and when the light sources are
helping.
To complete the discussion we now make the concept of warm
light precise in terms of chromaticity. Consider the light falling on
any given surface in the middle of the room. This light contains a
variety of different wavelengths. I ts character is specified, exactly,
by some distribution of spectral energies p(>..), which gives the
relative proportions of different wavelengths present in this light.
We know that any light whatsoever-in short, any p(>..)-can
be plotted as a single point on the color triangle-more formally
known as the two-dimensional chromaticity diagram-by means of
the standard color matching functions given in Gunter Wyszecki

 WARM COLORS
and W. S. Stiles, Color Science, New York, 67, pp. 28-317.
The coordinates of a plot in this color triangle define the chromaticity
of any given energy distribution.
Chromaticity diagram.
We may now identify a region on the chromaticity diagram
which we shall call the warm region. It is shown hatched on the
drawing.
This hatched area is based on a number of empirical results.
For example, we know that people have a clear subjective impression
of the relative warmth, or coldness, of different spaces.
See, for instance, Committee on Colorimetry of the Optical Society
of America, The Science of Color, New York, 53, p. .
One study which attempts to identify the objective correlates of
perceived "warmth" is S. M. Newhall, "Warmth and Coolness of
Colors," Psychological Record, , 41, pp. I 8- . Th is study
revealed a maximum for "wannest" judgments at dominant
wave-length  millimicrons, which is in the middle of the
orange range. And individual observer stability in such judgments
is high. Thus, one study gives reliability coefficients of 0. for
warmth and 0. for coolness-N. Collins, "The Appropriateness
of Certain Color Combinations in Advertising," M. A. thesis, Columbia
University, New York, 24.
Finally, it is vital to remember that this pattern requires only
that the light-the total light in the middle of a room, coming
from sunlight, artificial lights, reflections from walls, reflections
from outside, from carpets-the total light, lies in that part of the
color triangle we call "warm." It does not require that any individual
color surfaces in the room should be red or orange or

yellow-only that the combined effect of all the surfaces and
lights together, creates light in the middle of the room which lies
in the warm part of the color triangle.
Therefore:
Choose surface colors which, together with the color of
the natural light, reflected light, and artificial lights, create
a warm light in the rooms.

 I DIFFERENT CHAIRS
I I
... when you are ready to furnish rooms, choose the variety of
furniture as carefully as you have made the building, so that each
piece of furniture, loose or built in, has the same unique and
organic individuality as the rooms and alcoves have-each
different, according to the place it occupies-SEQUENCE OF
SITTING SPACES 2), SITTING CIRCLE 5), BUILT-IN SEATS
( 02).
People are different sizes; they sit in different ways.
And yet there is a tendency in modern times to make all
chairs alike.
Of course, this tendency to make all chairs alike is fueled by
the demands of prefabrication and the supposed economies of
scale. Designers have for years been creating "perfect chairs"chairs
that can be manufactured cheaply in mass. These chairs are
made to be comfortable for the average person. And the institutions
that buy chairs have been persuaded that buying these
chairs in bulk meets all their needs.
But what it means is that some people are chronically uncomfortable;
and the variety of moods among people sitting gets entirely
stifled.
Obviously, the "average chair" is good for some, but not for
everyone. Short and tall people are likely to be uncomfortable.
And although situations are roughly uniform-in a restaurant
everyone is eating, in an office everyone is working at a tableeven
so, there are important distinctions: people sitting for different
lengths of time; people sitting back and musing; people
sitting aggressively forward in a hot discussion; people sitting
formally, waiting for a few minutes. lf the chairs are all the same,
these differences are repressed, and some people are uncomfortable.
What is less obvious, and yet perhaps most important of all,
is this: we project our moods and personalities into the chairs
we sit in. In one mood a big fat chair is just right; in another
I

 DIFFERENT CHAIRS
mood, a rocking chair; for another, a stiff upright; and yet again,
a stool or sofa. And, of course, it isn't only that we like to switch
according to our mood; one of them is our favorite chair, the one
that makes us most secure and comfortable; and that again is different
for each person. A setting that is full of chairs, all slightly
different, immediately creates an amosphere which supports rich
experience; a setting which contains chairs that are all alike puts
a subtle straight jacket on experience.
Therefore:
Never furnish any place with chairs that are identically
the same. Choose a variety of different chairs, some big,
some small, some softer than others, some rockers, . some
very old, some new, with arms, without arms, some wicker,
some wood, some cloth.

Uniform illumination-the sweetheart of the lighting
engineers-serves no useful purpose whatsoever. In fact, it
destroys the social nature of space, and makes people feel
disoriented and unbounded.
Look at this picture. It is an egg-crate ceiling, with dozens of
evenly spaced fluorescent lights above it. It is meant to make the
light as flat and even as possible, in a mistaken effort to imitate
the sky.
Flat, even light.
But it is based on two mistakes. First of all, the light outdoors
1s almost never even. Most natural places, and especially the
I I 0
 POOLS OF LIGHT
conditions under which the human organism evolved, have
dappled light which varies continuously from minute to minute,
and from place to place.
More serious, it is a fact of human nature that the space we
use as social space is in part defined by light. When the light is
perfectly even, the social function of the space gets utterly destroyed:
it even becomes difficult for people to form natural human
groups. If a group is in an area of uniform illumination, there
are no light gradients corresponding to the boundary of the
group, so the definition, cohesiveness, and "existence" of the
group will be weakened. If the group is within a "pool" of light,
whose size and boundaries correspond to those of the group, th is
enchances the definition, cohesiveness, and even the phenomenological
existence of the group.
One possible explanation is suggested by the experiments of
Hopkinson and Longmore, who showed that small bright light
sources distract the attention less than large areas which are less
bright. These authors conclude that local lighting over a work
table allows the worker to pay more attention to his work than
uniform background lighting does. It seems reasonable to infer that
the high degree of person to person attention required to maintain
the cohesiveness of a social group is more likely to be sustained
if the group has local lighting, than if it has uniform background
lighting. See R. G. Hopkinson and J. Longmore, "Attention
and Distraction in the Lighting of Workplaces," Ergonomics, ,
1959, p.  ff. Also reprinted in R. G. Hopkinson, Lighting,
London: HMSO, 63, pp. 1-68.)
On-the-spot observation supports this conjecture. At the International
House, University of California, Berkeley, there is a
large room which is a general waiting and sitting lounge for guests
and residents. There are  seats in the room, I  of them are next
to lamps. At the two times of observation we counted a total of  I
people sitting in the room;  of them chose to sit next to
lamps. These figures show that people prefer sitting near
lights X = 1.4, significant at the 0.1% level). Yet the
overall light level in the room was high enough for reading. We
conclude that people do seek "pools of light."
Everyday experience bears out the same observation m

peace. Again, house dining tables often have a single lamp suspended
over the table-the light seems almost to act like glue for
all the people sitting round the table. In larger situations the
same thing seems to be true. Think of the park bench, under a
solitary light, and the privacy of the world which it creates for
a pair of lovers. Or, in a trucking depot, the solidarity of the
group of men sipping coffee around a brightly lit coffee stand.
One word of caution. This pattern is easy to understand; and
perhaps it is easy to agree with. But it is quite a subtle matter to
actually create functioning pools of light in the environment. We
know of many failures: for example, places where small lights do
break down even illumination, but do not correspond in any real
way with the places where people tend to gather in the space.
Light pools at odds with social space.
Therefore:
Place the lights low, and apart, to form individual pools
of light which encompass chairs and tables like bubbles to
reinforce the social character of the spaces which they form.
Remember that you can't have pools of light without the
darker places in between.

 THINGS FROM
YOUR LIFE*
... lastly, when you have taken care of everything, and you
start living in the places you have made, you may wonder what
kinds of things to pin up on the walls.
"Decor" and the conception of "interior design" have
spread so widely, that very often people forget their instinct
for the things they really want to keep around them.
There are two ways of looking at this simple fact. We may
look at it from the point of view of the person who owns the
space, and from the point of view of the people who come to it.
From the owner's point of view, it is obvious that the things
around you should be the things which mean most to you, which
have the power to play a part in the continuous process of selftransformation,
which is your life. That much is clear.
But this function has been eroded, gradually, in modern times
because people have begun to look outward, to others, and over
their shoulders, at the people who are coming to visit them, and
have replaced their natural instinctive decorations with the things
which they believe will please and impress their visitors. This
is the motive behind all the interior design and decor in the
women's magazines. And designers play on these anxieties by
making total designs, telling people they have no right to move
anything, paint the walls, or add a plant, because they are not
party to the mysteries of Good Design.
But the irony is, that the visitors who come into a room don't
want this nonsense any more than the people who live there. It
is far more fascinating to come into a room which is the living
expression of a person, or a group of people, so that you can see
their lives, their histories, their inclinations, displayed in manifest
form around the walls, in the furniture, on the shelves. Beside
such experience-and it is as ordinary as the grass-the artificial
scene-making of "modern decor" is totally bankrupt.
Jung describes the room that was his study, how he filled the
stone walls with paintings that he made each day directly on

CONSTRUCTION
the stones-mandalas, dream images, preoccupations-and he
tells us that the room came gradually to be a living thing to
him-the outward counterpart to his unconscious.
Examples we know: A motel run by a Frenchman, mementos
of the Resistance all around the lounge, the letter from Charles
de Gaulle. An outdoor market on the highway, where the
proprietor has mounted his collection of old bottles all over the
walls; hundreds of bottles, all shapes and colors; some of them
are down for cleaning; there is an especially beautiful one up at
the counter by the cash register. An anarchist runs the hot dog
stand, he plasters the walls with literature, proclamations, manifestoes
against the State.
A hunting glove, a blind man's cane, the collar of a favorite
dog, a panel of pressed flowers from the time when we were
children, oval pictures of grandma, a candlestick, the dust from a
volcano carefully kept in a bottle, a picture from the news of
prison convicts at Attica in charge of the prison, not knowing
that they were about to die, an old photo, the wind blowing in
the grass and a church steeple in the distance, spiked sea shells
with the hum of the sea still in them.
Therefore:
Do not be tricked into believing that modern decor must
be slick or psychedelic, or "natural" or "modern art," or
"plants" or anything else that current taste-makers claim.
It is most beautiful when it comes straight from your life
-the things you care for, the things that tell your story.
