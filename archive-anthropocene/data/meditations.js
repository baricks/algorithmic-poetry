[
  "Sit with your feet on the floor.",

  "Stretch. Hands up high, then forward fold. Swing your arms. Be in your body."

var  meditations2 = [
  "Think of something you have loved enough to name. Breathe in once more and say that name into the empty room.",
  "Think of a time when you saw an animal for what it was. Wild or tame, in love or fear. What, above all, do you remember about the animal?",
  "Think of an animal, any animal (or thing?). Now think of two hundred of them."

var meditations3 =
[
  "Make the sound of an animal. Any animal.",
  "Make the shape of an animal. Trunk, fangs, mouth. Four-legged, hind-legged. Get into it.",
  "Say its name. Then say the word goodbye out loud. Say it as many times as you want.",
  "Imagine a day in the animal’s life. Given how it looks, where do you think it lived? What do you think it ate? Where did it sleep? How did it play?",
  "With your eyes closed, imagining the animal, make a goodbye motion with your body. You can wave, or embrace, or blow a kiss. You can move fast or slow or in between."

  "Move in a way that expresses how you feel right now. End in a specific shape and hold it for ten seconds.",
  "Pick one expression and act it out: laugh, cry, shout, growl.",
  "Imagine 200 of one animal. As the poem disappears, imagine those animals disappearing.",
  "With your eyes closed, speak an apology to the animal—on behalf of yourself or your species. Be specific. What do you regret? What pain are you sorry for causing? What do you commit to not do again?",
  "Tell the animal one thing about yourself, then ask them a question—any question."

var meditations5 =
[
  "As the poem disappears, imagine the details of extinction. What would it be like to wake up and have no food? To not see anyone of your species for days or months or even the rest of your life? To have the place where you sleep taken over by someone else? To fear for your children? Speak out loud the first word that describes what you feel thinking about this.",
  "Choose one thing to do after: bring up the animal in conversation; say its name in your favorite outdoor place; learn something about its habitat, play, eating, sleeping or mating habits; build a small altar and leave something for the animal on it; place a small stone to mark a grave for the creature; donate money to a wildlife conservation group; get involved in a group fighting climate change; writer a letter to your congressperson in support of an endangered species, a conservation policy, or the Green New Deal.",
  "Indigenous author and biologist Robin Wall Kimmerer refuses to refer to animals and plants by the pronoun “it.” Instead, she uses “they” to recognize their sentience and their subjectivity. For the next week, refer to animals you speak of with subjective pronouns, and notice how it affects your thinking."
